<span style="color:#0070c0">"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) subserves cognitive control: the ability to coordinate thoughts or actions in relation with internal goals. Its functional architecture, however, remains poorly understood. Using brain imaging in humans, we showed that the lateral PFC is organized as a cascade of executive processes from premotor to anterior PFC regions that control behavior according to stimuli, the present perceptual context, and the temporal episode in which stimuli occur, respectively. The results support an unified modular model of cognitive control that describes the overall functional organization of the human lateral PFC and has basic methodological and theoretical implications."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Polycomb response elements (PREs) are specific cis -regulatory sequences needed for transcriptional repression of HOX and other target genes by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. Among the many PcG proteins known in Drosophila , Pho is the only sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. To gain insight into the function of Pho, we purified Pho protein complexes from Drosophila embryos and found that Pho exists in two distinct protein assemblies: a Pho–dINO80 complex containing the Drosophila INO80 nucleosome-remodeling complex, and a Pho-repressive complex (PhoRC) containing the uncharacterized gene product dSfmbt. Analysis of PhoRC reveals that dSfmbt is a novel PcG protein that is essential for HOX gene repression in Drosophila . PhoRC is bound at HOX gene PREs in vivo, and this targeting strictly depends on Pho-binding sites. Characterization of dSfmbt protein shows that its MBT repeats have unique discriminatory binding activity for methylated lysine residues in histones H3 and H4; the MBT repeats bind mono- and di-methylated H3-K9 and H4-K20 but fail to interact with these residues if they are unmodified or tri-methylated. Our results establish PhoRC as a novel Drosophila PcG protein complex that combines DNA-targeting activity (Pho) with a unique modified histone-binding activity (dSfmbt). We propose that PRE-tethered PhoRC selectively interacts with methylated histones in the chromatin flanking PREs to maintain a Polycomb-repressed chromatin state."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The intestinal epithelium is in direct contact with a vast microbiota, yet little is known about how epithelial cells defend the host against the heavy bacterial load. To address this question we studied Paneth cells, a key small intestinal epithelial lineage. We found that Paneth cells directly sense enteric bacteria through cell-autonomous MyD88-dependent toll-like receptor (TLR) activation, triggering expression of multiple antimicrobial factors. Paneth cells were essential for controlling intestinal barrier penetration by commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, Paneth cell-intrinsic MyD88 signaling limited bacterial penetration of host tissues, revealing a role for epithelial MyD88 in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Our findings establish that gut epithelia actively sense enteric bacteria and play an essential role in maintaining host-microbial homeostasis at the mucosal interface."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"TREX1 is an exonuclease that digests DNA in the cytoplasm. Loss-of-function mutations of TREX1 are linked to Aicardi–Goutieres Syndrome (AGS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in humans. Trex1 −/− mice exhibit autoimmune and inflammatory phenotypes that are associated with elevated expression of interferon (IFN)-induced genes (ISGs). Cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor that activates the IFN pathway. Upon binding to DNA, cGAS is activated to catalyze the synthesis of cGAMP, which functions as a second messenger that binds and activates the adaptor protein STING to induce IFNs and other cytokines. Here we show that genetic ablation of cGas in Trex1 −/− mice eliminated all detectable pathological and molecular phenotypes, including ISG induction, autoantibody production, aberrant T-cell activation, and lethality. Even deletion of just one allele of cGas largely rescued the phenotypes of Trex1 −/− mice. Similarly, deletion of cGas in mice lacking DNaseII, a lysosomal enzyme that digests DNA, rescued the lethal autoimmune phenotypes of the DNaseII −/− mice. Through quantitative mass spectrometry, we found that cGAMP accumulated in mouse tissues deficient in Trex1 or DNaseII and that this accumulation was dependent on cGAS. These results demonstrate that cGAS activation causes the autoimmune diseases in Trex1 −/− and DNaseII −/− mice and suggest that inhibition of cGAS may lead to prevention and treatment of some human autoimmune diseases caused by self-DNA."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Sphingolipids exhibit extreme functional and chemical diversity that is in part determined by their hydrophobic moiety, ceramide. In mammals, the fatty acyl chain length variation of ceramides is determined by six (dihydro)ceramide synthase (CerS) isoforms. Previously, we and others showed that mutations in the major neuron-specific CerS1, which synthesizes 18-carbon fatty acyl (C 18 ) ceramide, cause elevation of long-chain base (LCB) substrates and decrease in C 18 ceramide and derivatives in the brain, leading to neurodegeneration in mice and myoclonus epilepsy with dementia in humans. Whether LCB elevation or C 18 ceramide reduction leads to neurodegeneration is unclear. Here, we ectopically expressed CerS2, a nonneuronal CerS producing C 22 –C 24 ceramides, in neurons of Cers1 -deficient mice. Surprisingly, the Cers1 mutant pathology was almost completely suppressed. Because CerS2 cannot replenish C 18 ceramide, the rescue is likely a result of LCB reduction. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that only LCBs, the substrates common for all of the CerS isoforms, but not ceramides and complex sphingolipids, were restored to the wild-type levels in the Cers2 -rescued Cers1 mutant mouse brains. Furthermore, LCBs induced neurite fragmentation in cultured neurons at concentrations corresponding to the elevated levels in the CerS1-deficient brain. The strong association of LCB levels with neuronal survival both in vivo and in vitro suggests high-level accumulation of LCBs is a possible underlying cause of the CerS1 deficiency-induced neuronal death."</span>

Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown in animal models to improve the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy. We thus treated 14 patients with metastatic melanoma by using serial i.v. administration of a fully human anti-CTLA-4 antibody (MDX-010) in conjunction with s.c. vaccination with two modified HLA-A * 0201-restricted peptides from the gp100 melanoma-associated antigen, gp100:209–217(210M) and gp100:280–288(288V). This blockade of CTLA-4 induced grade III/IV autoimmune manifestations in six patients (43%), including dermatitis, enterocolitis, hepatitis, and hypophysitis, and mediated objective cancer regression in three patients (21%; two complete and one partial responses).

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Access to the splenic white pulp is restricted to lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Here we show that movement of molecules from the blood into these confined areas is also limited. Large molecules, such as bovine serum albumin (68 kD), immunoglobulin G (150 kD), and 500 kD dextran are unable to enter the white pulp, whereas smaller blood-borne molecules can directly permeate this compartment. The distribution is restricted to a stromal network that we refer to as the splenic conduit system. The small lumen of the conduit contains collagen fibers and is surrounded in the T cell areas by reticular fibroblasts that express ER-TR7. It also contains the chemokine CCL21. Conversely, in B cell follicles the B cell–attracting chemokine CXCL13 was found to be associated with the conduit and absence of ER-TR7+ fibroblasts. These results show heterogeneity of reticular fibroblasts that enfold the conduit system and suggest that locally produced chemokines are transported through and presented on this reticular network. Therefore, the conduit plays a role in distribution of both blood-borne and locally produced molecules and provides a framework for directing lymphocyte migration and organization of the splenic white pulp."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Recent studies have shown that activating mutations of NOTCH1 are responsible for the majority of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cases. Most of these mutations truncate its C-terminal domain, a region that is important for the NOTCH1 proteasome-mediated degradation. We report that the E3 ligase FBW7 targets NOTCH1 for ubiquitination and degradation. Our studies map in detail the amino acid degron sequence required for NOTCH1–FBW7 interaction. Furthermore, we identify inactivating FBW7 mutations in a large fraction of human T-ALL lines and primary leukemias. These mutations abrogate the binding of FBW7 not only to NOTCH1 but also to the two other characterized targets, c-Myc and cyclin E. The majority of the FBW7 mutations were present during relapse, and they were associated with NOTCH1 HD mutations. Interestingly, most of the T-ALL lines harboring FBW7 mutations were resistant to γ-secretase inhibitor treatment and this resistance appeared to be related to the stabilization of the c-Myc protein. Our data suggest that FBW7 is a novel tumor suppressor in T cell leukemia, and implicate the loss of FBW7 function as a potential mechanism of drug resistance in T-ALL."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The GTPases Rac and Cdc42 play a pivotal role in the establishment of cell polarity by stimulating biogenesis of tight junctions (TJs). In this study, we show that the Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1 (T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis) controls the cell polarity of epidermal keratinocytes. Similar to wild-type (WT) keratinocytes, Tiam1-deficient cells establish primordial E-cadherin–based adhesions, but subsequent junction maturation and membrane sealing are severely impaired. Tiam1 and V12Rac1 can rescue the TJ maturation defect in Tiam1-deficient cells, indicating that this defect is the result of impaired Tiam1–Rac signaling. Tiam1 interacts with Par3 and aPKCζ, which are two components of the conserved Par3–Par6–aPKC polarity complex, and triggers biogenesis of the TJ through the activation of Rac and aPKCζ, which is independent of Cdc42. Rac is activated upon the formation of primordial adhesions (PAs) in WT but not in Tiam1-deficient cells. Our data indicate that Tiam1-mediated activation of Rac in PAs controls TJ biogenesis and polarity in epithelial cells by association with and activation of the Par3–Par6–aPKC polarity complex."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The mechanism through which gene expression originating from the single male or the two female X chromosomes in Drosophila is adjusted to autosomal gene expression has remained controversial. According to the prevalent model, transcription of the male X is increased twofold by the male-specific-lethal (MSL) complex. However, a significant body of data supports an alternative model, whereby compensation involves a global repression of autosomal gene expression in males by sequestration and neutralization of an activator onto the X chromosome. In order to rigorously discriminate between these models we identified direct target genes for the MSL complex and quantified transcription in absolute terms after knockdown of MSL2. The results unequivocally document an approximate twofold activation of target genes by the MSL complex."</span>

Methods Digital brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical outcomes were studied retrospectively in a single center, including 45 children with postoperative lesions in the sellar region (41 craniopharyngiomas, 4 with Rathke's cleft cysts), ∼5 years post‐surgery, mean age 13.9 years. Four standard sections covering hypothalamic areas critical to energy homeostasis were used to assess lesions and calculate a hypothalamic lesion score (HLS); the association with HO was examined. Results Compared to subjects who did not develop HO ( n = 23), subjects with HO ( n = 22) showed more frequently lesions affecting the third ventricular floor, mammillary bodies, and anterior, medial (all P &lt; 0.05), and most importantly posterior hypothalamus ( P &lt; 0.01). The HLS correlated significantly with BMI z ‐score changes 12 and 30 months post‐surgery, even after adjusting for potential confounders of gender, age at surgery, surgery date, surgery BMI z ‐score, hydrocephalus, and residual hypothalamic tumor ( r = 0.34, P = 0.03; r = 0.40, P = 0.02, respectively).

To determine how DCs induce Th1 differentiation in the absence of IL-12, we examined the response of IL-12–deficient DCs to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We find that LPS activates MyD88-dependent Delta 4 Notch-like ligand expression by CD8− DCs, and that these cells direct Th1 differentiation by an IL-12–independent and Notch-dependent mechanism in vitro and in vivo.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Tetherin/BST2 is a type-II membrane protein that inhibits the release of a range of enveloped viruses, including HIV-1. Here we report three crystal structures of human tetherin, including the full-length ectodomain, a triple cysteine mutant and an ectodomain truncation. These structures show that tetherin forms a continuous alpha helix encompassing almost the entire ectodomain. Tetherin helices dimerize into parallel coiled coils via interactions throughout the C-terminal portion of the ectodomain. A comparison of the multiple structures of the tetherin dimer reveals inherent constrained flexibility at two hinges positioned at residues A88 and G109.

However, mutagenesis studies suggest that the tetrametric form of tetherin, although potentially contributing to, is not essential for its antiviral activity.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"To understand how virulent mycobacteria subvert host immunity and establish disease, we examined the differential response of mice to infection with various human outbreak Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates. One clinical isolate, HN878, was found to be hypervirulent, as demonstrated by unusually early death of infected immune-competent mice, compared with infection with other clinical isolates. The differential effect on survival required lymphocyte function because severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice infected with HN878 or other clinical isolates all died at the same rate. The hypervirulence of HN878 was associated with failure to induce M. tuberculosis -specific proliferation and IFN-γ production by spleen and lymph node cells from infected mice. In addition, 2- to 4-fold lower levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-γ mRNAs were observed in lungs of HN878-infected mice. IL-10, IL-4, and IL-5 mRNA levels were not significantly elevated in lungs of HN878 infected mice. In contrast, IFN-α mRNA levels were significantly higher in lungs of these mice. To further investigate the role of Type 1 IFNs, mice infected with HN878 were treated intranasally with purified IFN-α/β. The treatment resulted in increased lung bacillary loads and even further reduced survival. These results suggest that the hypervirulence of HN878 may be due to failure of this strain to stimulate Th1 type immunity. In addition, the lack of development of Th1 immunity in response to HN878 appears to be associated with increased induction of Type 1 IFNs."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Mesenchymal stromal cells or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have captured considerable scientific and public interest because of their potential to limit physical and immune injury, to produce bioactive molecules and to regenerate tissues. MSCs are phenotypically heterogeneous and distinct subpopulations within MSC cultures are presumed to contribute to tissue repair and the modulation of allogeneic immune responses. As the first example of efficacy, clinical trials for prevention and treatment of graft-versus-host disease after hematopoietic cell transplantation show that MSCs can effectively treat human disease. The view of the mechanisms whereby MSCs function as immunomodulatory and reparative cells has evolved simultaneously. Initially, donor MSCs were thought to replace damaged cells in injured tissues of the recipient. More recently, however, it has become increasingly clear that even transient MSC engraftment may exert favorable effects through the secretion of cytokines and other paracrine factors, which engage and recruit recipient cells in productive tissue repair. Thus, an important reason to investigate MSCs in mechanistic preclinical models and in clinical trials with well-defined end points and controls is to better understand the therapeutic potential of these multifunctional cells. Here, we review the controversies and recent insights into MSC biology, the regulation of alloresponses by MSCs in preclinical models, as well as clinical experience with MSC infusions (Table 1) and the challenges of manufacturing a ready supply of highly defined transplantable MSCs."</span>

These life-history strategies present different social organizations and reproductive modes, from near-random mating in protandry, to aggregate- and harem-spawning in protogyny. Using a combination of theoretical and molecular approaches, we compared variance in reproductive success ( V k *) and effective population sizes ( N e ) in several species of sex-changing fish. We observed that, regardless of the direction of sex change, individuals conform to the same overall strategy, producing more offspring and exhibiting greater V k * in the second sex. However, protogynous species show greater V k *, especially pronounced in haremic species, resulting in an overall reduction of N e compared to protandrous species. Collectively and independently, our results demonstrate that the direction of sex change is a pivotal variable in predicting demographic changes and resilience in sex-changing fish, many of which sustain highly valued and vulnerable fisheries worldwide."</span>

Misexpression of the knox genes, KNAT1 or KNAT2, in Arabidopsis produces a variety of phenotypes, including lobed leaves and ectopic stipules and meristems in the sinus, the region between lobes. We sought to determine the mechanisms that control knox gene expression in the shoot by examining recessive mutants that share phenotypic characteristics with 35S::KNAT1 plants. Double mutants of serrate (se) with either asymmetric1 (as1) or asymmetric2 (as2) showed lobed leaves, ectopic stipules in the sinuses and defects in the timely elongation of sepals, petals and stamens, similar to 35S::KNAT1 plants. Ectopic stipules and in rare cases, ectopic meristems, were detected in the sinuses on plants that were mutant for pickle and either as1 or as2. KNAT1 and KNAT2 were misexpressed in the leaves and flowers of single as1 and as2 mutants and in the sinuses of leaves of the different double mutants, but not in se or pickle single mutants. These results suggest that AS1 and AS2 promote leaf differentiation through repression of knox expression in leaves, and that SE and PKL globally restrict the competence to respond to genes that promote morphogenesis."</span>

These patients harbor autoantibodies to RPC1, an RNA polymerase subunit encoded by the POLR3A gene. Joseph et al. (p. 152 , published online December 5; see the Perspective by Teng and Smyth ) explored whether the RPC1 autoantibodies target a “foreign” antigen derived from a mutated POLR3A gene. Sequence analysis revealed that POLR3A mutations were present in tumors from six of eight patients with RPC1 autoantibodies but in no tumors from eight control patients who lacked RPC1 autoantibodies. Cell culture data suggested that the POLR3A mutations triggered cellular and humoral immune responses in the patients. These results provide support for the “immunosurveillance” hypothesis, which posits the continual eradication of nascent tumor cells via immune responses."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Unlike wild-type mouse melanocytes, where melanosomes are concentrated in dendrites and dendritic tips, melanosomes in dilute (myosin Va−) melanocytes are concentrated in the cell center. Here we sought to define the role that myosin Va plays in melanosome transport and distribution. Actin filaments that comprise a cortical shell running the length of the dendrite were found to exhibit a random orientation, suggesting that myosin Va could drive the outward spreading of melanosomes by catalyzing random walks. In contrast to this mechanism, time lapse video microscopy revealed that melanosomes undergo rapid (∼1.5 μm/s) microtubule-dependent movements to the periphery and back again. This bidirectional traffic occurs in both wild-type and dilute melanocytes, but it is more obvious in dilute melanocytes because the only melanosomes in their periphery are those undergoing this movement. While providing an efficient means to transport melanosomes to the periphery, this component does not by itself result in their net accumulation there. These observations, together with previous studies showing extensive colocalization of myosin Va and melanosomes in the actin-rich periphery, suggest a mechanism in which a myosin Va–dependent interaction of melanosomes with F-actin in the periphery prevents these organelles from returning on microtubules to the cell center, causing their distal accumulation. This “capture” model is supported by the demonstration that (a) expression of the myosin Va tail domain within wild-type cells creates a dilute-like phenotype via a process involving initial colocalization of tail domains with melanosomes in the periphery, followed by an ∼120-min, microtubule-based redistribution of melanosomes to the cell center; (b) microtubule-dependent melanosome movement appears to be damped by myosin Va; (c) intermittent, microtubule-independent, ∼0.14 μm/s melanosome movements are seen only in wild-type melanocytes; and (d) these movements do not drive obvious spreading of melanosomes over 90 min. We conclude that long-range, bidirectional, microtubule-dependent melanosome movements, coupled with actomyosin Va–dependent capture of melanosomes in the periphery, is the predominant mechanism responsible for the centrifugal transport and peripheral accumulation of melanosomes in mouse melanocytes. This mechanism represents an alternative to straightforward transport models when interpreting other myosin V mutant phenotypes."</span>

Shows, by comparing melanosome distribution and dynamics in wild-type versus dilute (myosin Va-null) melanocytes, that melanosome positioning is driven by a cooperation between long-range, microtubule-dependent melanosome transport and myosin Va-dependent melanosome capture (and possibly local movement) in the cell periphery (the cooperative-capture model).
This study proposes a model for melanosome distribution in mouse melanocytes, whereby bidirectional microtubule-dependent transport and myosin Va-dependent capture in the periphery drives peripheral accumulation, providing an alternative to simple directional transport models.

Gram‐positive microbes employ the cell wall peptidoglycan as a surface organelle for the covalent attachment of proteins, however, an assembly pathway for pili has not yet been revealed. We show here that pili of Corynebacterium diphtheriae are composed of three pilin subunits, SpaA, SpaB and SpaC. SpaA, the major pilin protein, is distributed uniformly along the pilus shaft, whereas SpaB is observed at regular intervals and SpaC seems positioned at the pilus tip. Assembled pili are released from the bacterial surface by treatment with murein hydrolase, suggesting that the pilus fibres may be anchored to the cell wall envelope. All three pilin subunit proteins are synthesized as precursors carrying N‐terminal signal peptides and C‐terminal sorting signals. Some, but not all, of the six sortase genes encoded in the genome of C. diphtheriae are required for precursor processing, pilus assembly or cell wall envelope attachment. Pilus assembly is proposed to occur by a mechanism of ordered cross‐linking, whereby pilin‐specific sortase enzymes cleave precursor proteins at sorting signals and involve the side chain amino groups of pilin motif sequences to generate links between pilin subunits. This covalent tethering of adjacent pilin subunits appears to have evolved in many Gram‐positive pathogens that encode sortase and pilin subunit genes with sorting signals and pilin motifs."</span>

A fraction of active ERK was found to be located in mitochondria in RWPE-2 cells, obtained by v-Ki-Ras transformation of the epithelial prostate RWPE-1 cell line; in metastatic prostate cancer DU145 cells; and in osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cells. All these tumor cells displayed marked resistance to death caused by apoptotic stimuli like arachidonic acid and the BH3 mimetic EM20-25, which cause cell death through the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). PTP desensitization and the ensuing resistance to cell death induced by arachidonic acid or EM20-25 could be ablated by inhibiting ERK with the drug PD98059 or with a selective ERK activation inhibitor peptide. ERK inhibition enhanced glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)-dependent phosphorylation of the pore regulator cyclophilin D, whereas GSK-3 inhibition protected from PTP opening. Neither active ERK in mitochondria nor pore desensitization was observed in non-transformed RWPE-1 cells. Thus, in tumor cells mitochondrial ERK activation desensitizes the PTP through a signaling axis that involves GSK-3 and cyclophilin D, a finding that provides a mechanistic basis for increased resistance to apoptosis of neoplastic cells."</span>

The Ca 2+ sensor required for fast fusion is synaptotagmin-1. The activation energy of bilayer-bilayer fusion is very high (≈40 k B T ). We found that, in response to Ca 2+ binding, synaptotagmin-1 could promote SNARE-mediated fusion by lowering this activation barrier by inducing high positive curvature in target membranes on C2-domain membrane insertion. Thus, synaptotagmin-1 triggers the fusion of docked vesicles by local Ca 2+ -dependent buckling of the plasma membrane together with the zippering of SNAREs.

However, for specific networks, a realistic modeling approach based on the combination of available physiological, morphological and anatomical data is still an open issue. One of the main problems in the generation of realistic networks lies in the strategy adopted to build network connectivity. Here we propose a method to implement a neuronal network at single cell resolution by using the geometrical probability volumes associated with pre- and postsynaptic neurites. This allows us to build a network with plausible connectivity properties without the explicit use of computationally intensive touch detection algorithms using full 3D neuron reconstructions. The method has been benchmarked for the mouse hippocampus CA1 area, and the results show that this approach is able to generate full-scale brain networks at single cell resolution that are in good agreement with experimental findings. This geometric reconstruction of axonal and dendritic occupancy, by effectively reflecting morphological and anatomical constraints, could be integrated into structured simulators generating entire circuits of different brain areas facilitating the simulation of different brain regions with realistic models."</span>

The mechanism(s) determining the development and severity of pathology leading to symptoms are not fully understood. In a mouse model of H. pylori infection we analysed the influence of immunoregulatory CD4+CD25+ T cells on H. pylori colonization and gastritis. Athymic C57BL/6 nu/nu mice were reconstituted with (a) lymph node (LN) cells (b) LN cells depleted of CD25+ T cells (CD25– LN) or (c) not reconstituted at all. Mice were then infected orally with 3 × 108H. pylori SS1 bacteria. At 2 and 6 weeks after the inoculation there was a significant (P &amp;lt; 0·001) reduction in H. pylori colonization in athymic mice transferred with CD25– LN cells compared to mice transferred with LN cells. Colonization was still reduced at 12 weeks after inoculation. Mice transferred with CD25– LN cells showed an earlier onset and increased severity of gastritis as compared to mice receiving LN cells. Splenic cells isolated from mice receiving CD25– LN cells produced the highest level of IFN-γ on stimulation with H. pylori antigens in vitro, had a higher H. pylori-specific DTH response and increased infiltration of CD4+ T cells and macrophages in the gastric mucosa. Athymic mice not transferred with T cells had persistent high H. pylori colonization and displayed a normal gastric epithelium without inflammatory cells. In conclusion, CD4+CD25+ cells reduce immunopathology in H. pylori infection, possibly by reducing the activation of IFN-γ producing CD4+ T cells, even at the expense of a higher H. pylori load in the gastric mucosa."</span>

To uncover therapeutic targets for tumours with CCNE1 amplification, we undertook genome-scale CRISPR–Cas9-based synthetic lethality screens in cellular models of CCNE1 amplification. Here we report that increasing CCNE1 dosage engenders a vulnerability to the inhibition of the PKMYT1 kinase, a negative regulator of CDK1. To inhibit PKMYT1, we developed RP-6306, an orally bioavailable and selective inhibitor that shows single-agent activity and durable tumour regressions when combined with gemcitabine in models of CCNE1 amplification. RP-6306 treatment causes unscheduled activation of CDK1 selectively in CCNE1- overexpressing cells, promoting early mitosis in cells undergoing DNA synthesis. CCNE1 overexpression disrupts CDK1 homeostasis at least in part through an early activation of the MMB–FOXM1 mitotic transcriptional program. We conclude that PKMYT1 inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for CCNE1 -amplified cancers."</span>

Unpredictable and disparate age of cancer onset is a major challenge in the management of LFS. Genetic modifiers, including the MDM2-SNP309 polymorphism, and genetic anticipation have been suggested as plausible explanations for young age of tumor onset, but the molecular mechanisms for these observations are unknown. We speculated that telomere attrition will increase genomic instability and cause earlier tumor onset in successive generations. We analyzed mean telomere length and MDM2-SNP309 polymorphism status in individuals from multiple LFS families and controls. A total of 45 peripheral blood lymphocyte samples were analyzed from 9 LFS families and 15 controls. High rate of MDM2-SNP309 was found in TP53 carriers (P = 0.0003). In children, telomere length was shorter in carriers affected with cancer than in nonaffected carriers and wild-type controls (P &amp;lt; 0.0001). The same pattern was seen in adults (P = 0.002). Within each family, telomere length was shorter in children with cancer than in their nonaffected siblings and their noncarrier parents. Telomere attrition between children and adults was faster in carriers than in controls. Our results support the role of MDM2-SNP309 as a genetic modifier in LFS. The novel finding of accelerated telomere attrition in LFS suggests that telomere length could explain earlier age of onset in successive generations of the same family with identical TP53/MDM2-SNP309 genotypes. Furthermore, telomere shortening could predict genetic anticipation observed in LFS and may serve as the first rational biological marker for clinical monitoring of these patients.

By employing adenosine triphosphate, the residual tensile strain in the wide‐bandgap perovskite absorber is successfully converted to compressive strain, which mitigates light‐induced ion migration and phase segregation. Based on the wide‐bandgap perovskite with compressive strain, single‐junction solar cells with the n–i–p layout yield a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.53% with the smallest voltage deficits of 440 mV. These cells also maintain 83.60% of initial PCE after 2500 h operation at the maximum power point.

Whether cells acquire these different fates in a stochastic or programmed manner, however, is unclear. Duffy et al. (p. 338 , published online 5 January) used single-cell tracking to determine the times to division, differentiation into a plasmablast, isotype switching, and death of stimulated B lymphocytes. Statistical analysis and mathematical modeling revealed that these cell-fate decisions appear to be the result of random clocks: Which clock went off first (division, differentiation, or death), determined the fate of the cell. Barnett et al. (p. 342 , published online 15 December) sought to determine whether asymmetrical cell division, which is thought to contribute to effector cell-fate decisions in T cells, may be at work in B lymphocytes. Indeed, factors important for the initiation and maintenance of germinal center B lymphocyte identity, along with an ancestral polarity protein, were asymmetrically distributed and maintained their asymmetry during cell division."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Active nerve cells release vasodilators that increase their energy supply by dilating local blood vessels, a mechanism termed neurovascular coupling and the basis of BOLD functional neuroimaging signals. Here, we reveal a mechanism for cerebral blood flow control, a precapillary sphincter at the transition between the penetrating arteriole and first order capillary, linking blood flow in capillaries to the arteriolar inflow. The sphincters are encircled by contractile mural cells, which are capable of bidirectional control of the length and width of the enclosed vessel segment. The hemodynamic consequence is that precapillary sphincters can generate the largest changes in the cerebrovascular flow resistance of all brain vessel segments, thereby controlling capillary flow while protecting the downstream capillary bed and brain tissue from adverse pressure fluctuations. Cortical spreading depolarization constricts sphincters and causes vascular trapping of blood cells. Thus, precapillary sphincters are bottlenecks for brain capillary blood flow."</span>

Cotransduced cells showed reduced tumorigenicity, and tumor take was followed by regression in some mice. In vivo tumors were heavily infiltrated with DCs that were isolated, phenotyped, and tested in vitro for stimulation of tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). BALB/c C-26 carcinoma cells express the endogenous murine leukemia virus (MuLV) env gene as a tumor-associated antigen. This antigen is shared among solid tumors of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice and contains two epitopes, AH-1 and KSP, recognized in the context of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules H-2Ld and H-2Kb, respectively. DCs isolated from C-26/GM/CD40L tumors grown in (BALB/c × C57BL/6)F1 mice (H-2d×b) stimulated interferon γ production by both anti–AH-1 and KSP CTLs, whereas tumor-infiltrating DCs (TIDCs) of BALB/c mice stimulated only anti–AH-1 CTLs. Furthermore, TIDCs primed naive mice for CTL activity as early as 2 d after injection into the footpad, whereas double-transduced tumor cells required at least 5 d for priming; this difference may reflect direct DC priming versus indirect tumor cell priming. Immunohistochemical staining indicated colocalization of DCs and apoptotic bodies in the tumors. These data indicate that DCs infiltrating tumors that produce GM-CSF and CD40L can capture cellular antigens, likely through uptake of apoptotic bodies, and mature in situ to a stage suitable for antigen presentation. Thus, tumor cell–based vaccines engineered to favor the interaction with host DCs can be considered."</span>

Current guidelines recommend life-style interventions as first-line therapy for NAFLD and these types of intervention are considered standard-of-care. The current study establishes a reproducible mouse model of a life-style intervention in NAFLD using voluntary wheel running (VWR). Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet (HFD) to induce NAFLD or a corresponding control diet for 12 weeks. Starting at week 9 of the obesogenic NAFLD diet, mice were randomized to either free access to a running wheel or being single caged resembling a sedentary (SED) life-style. VWR induced a transient weight reduction in HFD-fed mice up until week 10. In contrast to the SED mice, VWR mice exhibited normal ALT at the end of the intervention, while the metabolic alterations including elevated fasting glucose, insulin, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels remained almost unchanged. Additionally, VWR prevented HFD-induced hepatic steatosis by alterations in key liver metabolic processes including the induction of fatty acid β-oxidation and lipogenesis inhibition following increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α activity. Phosphorylation of the serine kinase Akt in hepatic tissue was enhanced following VWR. Furthermore, VWR mice were protected from HFD-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and liver macrophage infiltration. The SED/HFD group exhibited increasing activity of hepatic nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65, which was absent following exercise in the VWR/HFD group. In summary, in an obesogenic mouse model of NAFLD physical exercise improves fatty acid and glucose homeostasis and protects from macrophage-associated hepatic inflammation."</span>

After the injection of lyso‐PtdCho into ex vivo spinal tissues or in vivo mouse sciatic nerves, myelin swelling characterized by the decrease of CARS intensity and loss of excitation polarization dependence was extensively observed. The swelling corresponds to myelin vesiculation and splitting observed by electron microscopy. The demyelination dynamics were quantified by the increase of g ratio measured from the CARS images. Treating spinal tissues with Ca 2+ ionophore A23187 resulted in the same kind of myelin degradation as lyso‐PtdCho. Moreover, the demyelination lesion size was significantly reduced upon preincubation of the spinal tissue with Ca 2+ free Krebs' solution or a cytosolic phospholipase A 2 (cPLA 2 ) inhibitor or a calpain inhibitor. In accordance with the imaging results, removal of Ca 2+ or addition of cPLA 2 inhibitor or calpain inhibitor in the Krebs' solution remarkably increased the mean compound action potential amplitude in lyso‐PtdCho treated spinal tissues. Our results suggest that lyso‐PtdCho induces myelin degradation via Ca 2+ influx into myelin and subsequent activation of cPLA 2 and calpain, which break down the myelin lipids and proteins.

Research Methods and Procedures: A rat genomic library was screened for genomic clones containing the CART gene and upstream DNA sequence. A clone containing exons 1 and 2 of the rat CART gene plus 1.2 kb of upstream sequence was isolated. The 1.2‐kb upstream sequence and truncated segments of this sequence were cloned into a luciferase reporter vector for analysis of transcriptional activity in the CART expressing pituitary GH3 cell line. Luciferase reporter assays, gel shift assays, and site‐directed mutagenesis were used to analyze potential regulatory regions in the 1.2‐kb 5′ DNA sequence. Results: Sequence analysis of the 1.2‐kb upstream sequence reveals several potential regulatory elements. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrate that within the first 162 bp of the start codon is a functional cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element that can induce cAMP‐regulated gene expression of the CART promoter in GH3 cells. Mutation of this positive control plasmid construct response element abolishes cAMP‐stimulated transcription. Furthermore, the promoter is active in a neuronal cell line where it also demonstrates cAMP responsiveness. Discussion: cAMP‐mediated transcription of the CART promoter may be an important aspect of the regulation of the CART gene. However, the cellular context of expression is also important because the CART promoter is not responsive to cAMP stimulation in all cell types. Other transcription factor binding sequences are likely to play a key role in CART promoter regulation."</span>

The S-phase marker bromodeoxyuridine was used as a surrogate of drug effect and administered 2 hours before tumor excision, whereas vessel position and perfusion were assessed via staining for CD31 and intravenous injection of carbocyanine, respectively. Hypoxia was detected using pimonidazole. Images of the four markers were overlaid to reveal the spatial relationship between proliferation, vasculature, and hypoxia and to examine the microregional effects. Within 1 day after administration of 240 mg/kg of gemcitabine, proliferation throughout the tumor was completely inhibited. Over time, a reemergence of dividing cells occurred in relation to the distance from vasculature. Microregional analysis revealed that cells located distal to vasculature commenced cycling sooner than cells located proximal to vasculature. A similar trend was seen after multiple doses of gemcitabine (40 mg/kg on days 1, 4, 7, and 10). The possibility that the effect of gemcitabine could be attributed to changes in oxygenation was discounted after examining the vessel perfusion and patterns of hypoxia. The effect of gemcitabine was examined in multilayered cell culture, and at doses &amp;lt;30 μmol/L, a gradient in proliferation between the exposed and unexposed sides was observed. We show a differential effect on cell proliferation in relation to vasculature and conclude that cells distal to blood vessels are less affected by gemcitabine probably because of limited penetration."</span>

Currently, there is no approved treatment for NASH. The mitochondrial citrate carrier, Slc25a1, has been proposed to play an important role in lipid metabolism, suggesting a potential role for this protein in the pathogenesis of this disease. Here, we show that Slc25a1 inhibition with a specific inhibitor compound, CTPI-2, halts salient alterations of NASH reverting steatosis, preventing the evolution to steatohepatitis, reducing inflammatory macrophage infiltration in the liver and adipose tissue, while starkly mitigating obesity induced by a high-fat diet. These effects are differentially recapitulated by a global ablation of one copy of the Slc25a1 gene or by a liver-targeted Slc25a1 knockout, which unravel dose-dependent and tissue-specific functions of this protein. Mechanistically, through citrate-dependent activities, Slc25a1 inhibition rewires the lipogenic program, blunts signaling from peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, a key regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism, and inhibits the expression of gluconeogenic genes. The combination of these activities leads not only to inhibition of lipid anabolic processes, but also to a normalization of hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance as well. In summary, our data show for the first time that Slc25a1 serves as an important player in the pathogenesis of fatty liver disease and thus, provides a potentially exploitable and novel therapeutic target."</span>

In a situation in which cellular influx from the thymus is blocked, TCR-deficient naïve T cells decay over time, the decay rates being faster for CD8 + cells ( t 1/2 ≈ 16 days) than for CD4 + cells ( t 1/2 ≈ 46 days). TCR + naïve cells are either maintained (CD8 + ) or decay more slowly (CD4 + ; t 1/2 ≈ 78 days.) Numbers of TCR-deficient memory T cells decline very slowly (CD8 + cells; t 1/2 ≈ 52 days) or not at all (CD4 + cells), but at the population level, these cells fail to expand as their TCR + counterparts do.

We have generated a neutralizing anti-PCSK9 antibody, mAb1, that binds to an epitope on PCSK9 adjacent to the region required for LDLR interaction. In vitro, mAb1 inhibits PCSK9 binding to the LDLR and attenuates PCSK9-mediated reduction in LDLR protein levels, thereby increasing LDL uptake. A combination of mAb1 with a statin increases LDLR levels in HepG2 cells more than either treatment alone. In wild-type mice, mAb1 increases hepatic LDLR protein levels ≈2-fold and lowers total serum cholesterol by up to 36%: this effect is not observed in LDLR −/− mice. In cynomolgus monkeys, a single injection of mAb1 reduces serum LDL-C by 80%, and a significant decrease is maintained for 10 days.

The models were forced by historical emissions and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 anthropogenic emissions of CO2 for the 1850–2100 time period. For each model, two simulations were performed in order to isolate the impact of climate change on the land and ocean carbon cycle, and therefore the climate feedback on the atmospheric CO2 concentration growth rate. There was unanimous agreement among the models that future climate change will reduce the efficiency of the earth system to absorb the anthropogenic carbon perturbation. A larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The higher CO2 levels led to an additional climate warming ranging between 0.1° and 1.5°C. All models simulated a negative sensitivity for both the land and the ocean carbon cycle to future climate. However, there was still a large uncertainty on the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to the ocean. Also, a majority of the models located the reduction of land carbon uptake in the Tropics. However, the attribution of the land sensitivity to changes in net primary productivity versus changes in respiration is still subject to debate; no consensus emerged among the models."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract The composition of the intestinal microbiota influences the development of inflammatory disorders. However, associating inflammatory diseases with specific microbial members of the microbiota is challenging, because clinically detectable inflammation and its treatment can alter the microbiota’s composition. Immunologic checkpoint blockade with ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) signalling, is associated with new-onset, immune-mediated colitis. Here we conduct a prospective study of patients with metastatic melanoma undergoing ipilimumab treatment and correlate the pre-inflammation faecal microbiota and microbiome composition with subsequent colitis development. We demonstrate that increased representation of bacteria belonging to the Bacteroidetes phylum is correlated with resistance to the development of checkpoint-blockade-induced colitis. Furthermore, a paucity of genetic pathways involved in polyamine transport and B vitamin biosynthesis is associated with an increased risk of colitis. Identification of these biomarkers may enable interventions to reduce the risk of inflammatory complications following cancer immunotherapy."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"H2AZ is a widely conserved histone variant that is implicated in protecting euchromatin from the spread of heterochromatin. H2AZ is incorporated into nucleosomes as a heterodimer with H2B, by the SWR1 ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex. We have identified a homolog of H2AZ in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, along with a novel variant of histone H2B (H2BV) that shares ∼38% sequence identity with major H2B. Both H2AZ and H2BV are essential for viability. H2AZ localizes within the nucleus in a pattern that is distinct from canonical H2A and is largely absent from sites of transcription visualized by incorporation of 5-bromo-UTP (BrUTP). H2AZ and H2BV colocalize throughout the cell cycle and exhibit nearly identical genomic distribution patterns, as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. H2AZ co-immunoprecipitates with H2BV but not with histones H2B or H2A nor with the variant H3V. These data strongly suggest that H2AZ and H2BV function together within a single nucleosome, marking the first time an H2AZ has been shown to associate with a non-canonical histone H2B."</span>

Whereas such data can be readily used for a wide range of biomedical applications, it has proven difficult to use them to generate high-quality de novo genome assemblies of large, repeat-rich vertebrate genomes. To date, the genome assemblies generated from such data have fallen far short of those obtained with the older (but much more expensive) capillary-based sequencing approach. Here, we report the development of an algorithm for genome assembly, ALLPATHS-LG, and its application to massively parallel DNA sequence data from the human and mouse genomes, generated on the Illumina platform. The resulting draft genome assemblies have good accuracy, short-range contiguity, long-range connectivity, and coverage of the genome. In particular, the base accuracy is high (≥99.95%) and the scaffold sizes (N50 size = 11.5 Mb for human and 7.2 Mb for mouse) approach those obtained with capillary-based sequencing.

To understand the contribution of the transcription machinery in the disassembly of the +1 H2A.Z nucleosome, conditional mutants were used to block PIC assembly. A quantitative ChIP-seq approach, which allows detection of global occupancy change, was employed to measure H2A.Z occupancy. Blocking PIC assembly resulted in promoter-specific H2A.Z accumulation, indicating that the PIC is required to evict H2A.Z. By contrast, H2A.Z eviction was unaffected upon depletion of INO80, a remodeler previously reported to displace nucleosomal H2A.Z. Robust PIC-dependent H2A.Z eviction was observed at active and infrequently transcribed genes, indicating that constitutive H2A.Z turnover is a general phenomenon. Finally, sites with strong H2A.Z turnover precisely mark transcript starts, providing a new metric for identifying cryptic and alternative sites of initiation."</span>

To understand how the presence of misfolded proteins leads to cellular dysfunction, we employed Caenorhabditis elegans polyglutamine aggregation models. Here, we find that polyglutamine expansions disrupted the global balance of protein folding quality control, resulting in the loss of function of diverse metastable proteins with destabilizing temperature-sensitive mutations. In turn, these proteins, although innocuous under normal physiological conditions, enhanced the aggregation of polyglutamine proteins.

Here we provide direct evidence for this provocative but largely untested idea and demonstrate why preparing multiple movements is computationally advantageous. Using a reaching task in which movements are initiated after one of two potential targets is cued, we show that the movement generated for the cued target borrows components of the movement that would have been required for the other, competing target. This interaction can only arise if multiple potential movements are fully specified in advance and we demonstrate that it reduces the time required to launch a given action plan.

This movement is coupled to channel opening. A recent model based on studies of the KvAP channel proposes that the positively charged voltage sensor, christened the “voltage-sensor paddle”, is a peripheral domain that shuttles its charged cargo through membrane lipid like a hydrophobic cation. We tested this idea by attaching charged adducts to cysteines introduced into the putative voltage-sensor paddle of Shaker potassium channels and measuring fractional changes in the total gating charge from gating currents. The only residues capable of translocating attached charges through the membrane-electric field are those that serve this function in the native channel. This remarkable specificity indicates that charge movement involves highly specialized interactions between the voltage sensor and other regions of the protein, a mechanism inconsistent with the paddle model."</span>

We found that Homer2 and Homer3, members of the Homer family of cytoplasmic scaffolding proteins, are negative regulators of T cell activation. This is achieved through binding of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and by competing with calcineurin. Homer-NFAT binding was also antagonized by active serine-threonine kinase AKT, thereby enhancing TCR signaling via calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of NFAT. This corresponded with changes in cytokine expression and an increase in effector-memory T cell populations in Homer-deficient mice, which also developed autoimmune-like pathology.

Claudins influence the charge selectivity and electrical resistance of junctions, but there is no direct evidence describing pore composition or whether pore size or density differs among cell types. To characterize paracellular pores independent of influences from charge selectivity, we profiled the `apparent permeabilities' (Papp) of a continuous series of noncharged polyethylene glycols (PEGs) across monolayers of five different epithelial cell lines and porcine ileum. We also characterized Papp of high and low electrical resistance MDCK cell monolayers expressing heterologous claudins. Papp profiling confirms that the paracellular barrier to noncharged solutes can be modeled as two distinct pathways: high-capacity small pores and a size-independent pathway allowing flux of larger solutes. All cell lines and ileum share a pore aperture of radius 4 Å. Using Papp of a PEG of radius 3.5 Å to report the relative pore number provides the novel insight that pore density along the junction varies among cell types and is not necessarily related to electrical resistance. Expression of claudin-2 results in a selective increase in pore number but not size and has no effect on the permeability of PEGs that are larger than the pores; however, neither knockdown of claudin-2 nor overexpression of several other claudins altered either the number of small pores or their size. We speculate that permeability of all small solutes is proportional to pore number but that small electrolytes are subject to further selectivity by the profile of claudins expressed, explaining the dissociation between the Papp for noncharged solutes and electrical resistance. Although claudins are likely to be components of the small pores, other factors might regulate pore number."</span>

To investigate cellular processes controlled by LMO4 and those that may be deregulated during oncogenesis, we used RNA interference. Down-regulation of LMO4 expression reduced proliferation of human breast cancer cells and increased differentiation of mouse mammary epithelial cells. Furthermore, small-interfering-RNA-transfected breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) had a reduced capacity to migrate and invade an extracellular matrix. Conversely, overexpression of LMO4 in noninvasive, immortalized human MCF10A cells promoted cell motility and invasion. Significantly, in a cohort of 159 primary breast cancers, high nuclear levels of LMO4 were an independent predictor of death from breast cancer.

The phenotypic spectrum of mitochondrial disease has expanded significantly since the original reports that associated classic clinical syndromes with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) rearrangements and point mutations. The revolution in genetic technologies has allowed interrogation of the nuclear genome in a manner that has dramatically improved the diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders. We comprehensively assessed the prevalence of all forms of adult mitochondrial disease to include pathogenic mutations in both nuclear and mtDNA. Methods Adults with suspected mitochondrial disease in the North East of England were referred to a single neurology center from 1990 to 2014. For the midyear period of 2011, we evaluated the minimum prevalence of symptomatic nuclear DNA mutations and symptomatic and asymptomatic mtDNA mutations causing mitochondrial diseases. Results The minimum prevalence rate for mtDNA mutations was 1 in 5,000 (20 per 100,000), comparable with our previously published prevalence rates. In this population, nuclear mutations were responsible for clinically overt adult mitochondrial disease in 2.9 per 100,000 adults. Interpretation Combined, our data confirm that the total prevalence of adult mitochondrial disease, including pathogenic mutations of both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes (≈1 in 4,300), is among the commonest adult forms of inherited neurological disorders. These figures hold important implications for the evaluation of interventions, provision of evidence‐based health policies, and planning of future services.

As ligand‐gated ion channels they were expected to mediate fast cholinergic transmission, yet their influence appears to be modulatory. Two reviews in this issue of the BJP consider the relationship between nAChRs and endogenous ACh, with respect to the modulation of dopaminergic signalling. In his review, Maskos posits that in midbrain dopamine neurons, somatodendritic nAChRs activated by cholinergic inputs from the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg) serve as a ‘gate’ that facilitates the switch to burst firing. In the terminal field, Exley and Cragg argue that nAChRs function as a ‘presynaptic filter’ to enhance the contrast between single and repetitive spike firing. Thus somatodendritic and presynaptic nAChRs exert subtle and complementary influences in responding to cholinergic inputs.

Despite control of viral infection by strong T cell responses in visceral organs cytomegalovirus replication continues in the salivary glands of mice, suggesting that the virus exploits the mucosal microenvironment. Here, we show that T cell immunity in the salivary glands is limited by the induction of CD4 T cells expressing the regulatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10. Blockade of IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) with an antagonist antibody dramatically reduced viral load in the salivary glands, but not in the spleen. The mucosa-specific protection afforded by IL-10R blockade was associated with an increased accumulation of CD4 T cells expressing interferon γ, suggesting that IL-10R signaling limits effector T cell differentiation. Consistent with this, an agonist antibody targeting the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member OX40 (TNFRSF4) enhanced effector T cell differentiation and increased the number of interferon γ–producing T cells, thus limiting virus replication in the salivary glands.

The miRNAs have diverse expression patterns during development: a let-7 paralog is temporally coexpressed with let-7 ; miRNAs encoded in a single genomic cluster are coexpressed during embryogenesis; and still other miRNAs are expressed constitutively throughout development. Potential orthologs of several of these miRNA genes were identified in Drosophila and human genomes. The abundance of these tiny RNAs, their expression patterns, and their evolutionary conservation imply that, as a class, miRNAs have broad regulatory functions in animals."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic modification that plays a key role associated with the regulation of gene expression during differentiation, but in disease states such as cancer, the DNA methylation landscape is often deregulated. There are now numerous technologies available to interrogate the DNA methylation status of CpG sites in a targeted or genome-wide fashion, but each method, due to intrinsic biases, potentially interrogates different fractions of the genome. In this study, we compare the affinity-purification of methylated DNA between two popular genome-wide techniques, methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) and methyl-CpG binding domain-based capture (MBDCap), and show that each technique operates in a different domain of the CpG density landscape. We explored the effect of whole-genome amplification and illustrate that it can reduce sensitivity for detecting DNA methylation in GC-rich regions of the genome. By using MBDCap, we compare and contrast microarray- and sequencing-based readouts and highlight the impact that copy number variation (CNV) can make in differential comparisons of methylomes. These studies reveal that the analysis of DNA methylation data and genome coverage is highly dependent on the method employed, and consideration must be made in light of the GC content, the extent of DNA amplification, and the copy number."</span>

Transport activity is depressed either in cells grown in the presence of methionine or in cells exposed to methionine immediately prior to harvest. Alpha-Keto-gamma-methiol-butyrate, D-methionine, or methionine sulfoxide have little effect on the initial rate of uptake of L-methionine when they are added simultaneously with the substrate. However, methionine transport is markedly reduced in cells exposed to these sources of L-methionine before the addition of substrate. This reduction is prevented if the cells are treated with amino oxyacetic acid. The initial rate of uptake into L-methionine-loaded cells was lower than that into unloaded cells. This inhibition affected both methionine transport systems and the inhibition by the internal pool appeared to be non-competitive with the external methionine concentration. Two classes of mutants with increased methionine pools have decreased rates of uptake. Conversely, starvation for methionine in a methionine auxotroph with high rates of methionine degradation resulted in a substantial increase in the rate of methionine transport. Thus, these transport systems are subject to regulation by the internal pool size and possibly by repression."</span>

Next, we studied whether EEG seizures per se induced IL-1β and microglia changes in the hippocampus using bicuculline as a nonexcitotoxic convulsant agent. Finally, to address the functional role of this cytokine, we measured the effect of human recombinant (hr)IL-1β on seizure activity as one marker of the response to kainate. Three and 24 hr after unilateral intrahippocampal application of 0.19 nmol of kainate, IL-1β immunoreactivity was enhanced in glia in the injected and the contralateral hippocampi. At 24 hr, IL-1β concentration increased by 16-fold ( p &lt; 0.01) in the injected hippocampus. Reactive microglia was enhanced with a pattern similar to IL-1β immunoreactivity. Intrahippocampal application of 0.77 nmol of bicuculline methiodide, which induces EEG seizures but not cell loss, enhanced IL-1β immunoreactivity and microglia, although to a less extent and for a shorter time compared with kainate. One nanogram of (hr)IL-1β intrahippocampally injected 10 min before kainate enhanced by 226% the time spent in seizures ( p &lt; 0.01). This effect was blocked by coinjection of 1 μg (hr)IL-1β receptor antagonist or 0.1 ng of 3-((+)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonate, selective antagonists of IL-1β and NMDA receptors, respectively.

With the intent of decreasing dependence on imports, supporting the economy, and potentially even overcoming the environmental problems related to conventional terrestrial mining, a number of public and private institutions have rediscovered their interest in exploring the prospects of deep‐sea mining, which had been deemed economically and technically unfeasible in the early 1980s. To date, many national and international research projects are grappling to understand the economic environmental, social, and legal implications of potential commercial deep‐sea mining operations: a challenging endeavor due to the complexity of direct impacts and spillover effects. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge in the aforementioned fields as well as a comparison of the impacts associated with conventional terrestrial mining. Furthermore, we identify knowledge gaps that should be urgently addressed to ensure that the world at large benefits from safe, efficient, and environmentally sound mining procedures.

We describe two DNA machines that enable the “ON/OFF” switchable activation and deactivation of three‐component biocatalytic cascades. One system consists of a reconfigurable DNA tweezers‐type structure, whereas in the second system the catalytic cascade proceeds on a switchable DNA clamp scaffold. The three‐component catalytic cascades consist of β‐galactosidase (β‐Gal), glucose oxidase (GOx), and the K + ‐ion‐stabilized hemin‐G‐quadruplex horseradish peroxidase (HRP)‐mimicking DNAzyme. The hemin‐G‐quadruplex‐bridged closed structure of the tweezers or clamp allows the biocatalytic cascades to operate (switched “ON′′), whereas separation of the hemin‐G‐quadruplex by means of 18‐crown‐6‐ether opens the tweezers/clamp structures, thus blocking the catalytic cascade (switched ”OFF“).

However, some adjuvants elicit production of cytokines resulting in adverse inflammatory consequences. Development of agents that selectively increase MHC class II and CD86 expression without triggering unwanted cytokine production requires a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms influencing the production and degradation of MHC class II and CD86 in DCs. Here, we investigate how CD83, an immunoglobulin protein expressed on the surface of mature DCs, promotes MHC class II and CD86 expression. Using mice with an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea–induced mutation eliminating the transmembrane (TM) region of CD83, we found that the TM domain of CD83 enhances MHC class II and CD86 expression by blocking MHC class II association with the ubiquitin ligase MARCH1. The TM region of CD83 blocks interleukin 10–driven, MARCH1-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of MHC class II and CD86 in DCs. Exploiting this posttranslational pathway for boosting MHC class II and CD86 expression on DCs may provide an opportunity to enhance the immunogenicity of vaccines."</span>

Traditionally, most large-scale industrial processes that use plant polysaccharides have burned lignin to generate the power needed to productively transform biomass. The advent of biorefineries that convert cellulosic biomass into liquid transportation fuels will generate substantially more lignin than necessary to power the operation, and therefore efforts are underway to transform it to value-added products. Advances Bioengineering to modify lignin structure and/or incorporate atypical components has shown promise toward facilitating recovery and chemical transformation of lignin under biorefinery conditions. The flexibility in lignin monomer composition has proven useful for enhancing extraction efficiency. Both the mining of genetic variants in native populations of bioenergy crops and direct genetic manipulation of biosynthesis pathways have produced lignin feedstocks with unique properties for coproduct development. Advances in analytical chemistry and computational modeling detail the structure of the modified lignin and direct bioengineering strategies for targeted properties. Refinement of biomass pretreatment technologies has further facilitated lignin recovery and enables catalytic modifications for desired chemical and physical properties. Outlook Potential high-value products from isolated lignin include low-cost carbon fiber, engineering plastics and thermoplastic elastomers, polymeric foams and membranes, and a variety of fuels and chemicals all currently sourced from petroleum. These lignin coproducts must be low cost and perform as well as petroleum-derived counterparts. Each product stream has its own distinct challenges. Development of renewable lignin-based polymers requires improved processing technologies coupled to tailored bioenergy crops incorporating lignin with the desired chemical and physical properties. For fuels and chemicals, multiple strategies have emerged for lignin depolymerization and upgrading, including thermochemical treatments and homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. The multifunctional nature of lignin has historically yielded multiple product streams, which require extensive separation and purification procedures, but engineering plant feedstocks for greater structural homogeneity and tailored functionality reduces this challenge."</span>

The biologic basis of the stereotypical progression from chronic phase through accelerated phase to blast crisis is poorly understood. We used DNA microarrays to compare gene expression in 91 cases of CML in chronic (42 cases), accelerated (17 cases), and blast phases (32 cases). Three thousand genes were found to be significantly ( P &lt; 10 −10 ) associated with phase of disease. A comparison of the gene signatures of chronic, accelerated, and blast phases suggest that the progression of chronic phase CML to advanced phase (accelerated and blast crisis) CML is a two-step rather than a three-step process, with new gene expression changes occurring early in accelerated phase before the accumulation of increased numbers of leukemia blast cells. Especially noteworthy and potentially significant in the progression program were the deregulation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway, the decreased expression of Jun B and Fos, alternative kinase deregulation, such as Arg (Abl2), and an increased expression of PRAME.

The mechanism of c‐di‐GMP signal transduction, including recognition of c‐di‐GMP and subsequent phenotypic regulation, remain largely uncharacterized. The key components of these regulatory pathways are the various adaptor proteins (c‐di‐GMP receptors). There is compelling evidence suggesting that, in addition to PilZ domains, there are other unidentified c‐di‐GMP receptors.

Analysis of PelD orthologues identified a number of conserved residues that are required for c‐di‐GMP binding as well as synthesis of the PEL polysaccharide. Secondary structure similarities of PelD to the inhibitory site of diguanylate cyclase suggest that a common fold can act as a platform to bind c‐di‐GMP.

Infrared photodissociation spectroscopy revealed that the Co−O bond in 1 is rather strong, in accordance with its lack of chemical reactivity. On the contrary, 2 has a very weak Co−O bond characterized by a stretching frequency of ≤659 cm −1 . Accordingly, 2 can abstract hydrogen atoms from non‐activated secondary alkanes.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Understanding the interplay between illumination and the electron distribution in metallic nanostructures is a crucial step towards developing applications such as plasmonic photocatalysis for green fuels, nanoscale photodetection and more. Elucidating this interplay is challenging, as it requires taking into account all channels of energy flow in the electronic system. Here, we develop such a theory, which is based on a coupled Boltzmann-heat equations and requires only energy conservation and basic thermodynamics, where the electron distribution, and the electron and phonon (lattice) temperatures are determined uniquely. Applying this theory to realistic illuminated nanoparticle systems, we find that the electron and phonon temperatures are similar, thus justifying the (classical) single-temperature models. We show that while the fraction of high-energy “hot” carriers compared to thermalized carriers grows substantially with illumination intensity, it remains extremely small (on the order of 10 −8 ). Importantly, most of the absorbed illumination power goes into heating rather than generating hot carriers, thus rendering plasmonic hot carrier generation extremely inefficient. Our formulation allows for the first time a unique quantitative comparison of theory and measurements of steady-state electron distributions in metallic nanostructures."</span>

ComK drives the expression of more than 100 genes constituting the semidormant K‐state, distinct from sporulation and vegetative growth. Among the genes so activated are those that permit competence for genetic transformation. We have addressed the origin of bistability in expression of ComK. We show that bistability requires positive autoregulation at the promoter of comK , but not a potential toggle switch, in which ComK represses the promoter of rok and Rok represses the promoter of comK .

Channel inhibition improves experimental autoimmune encephalitis, in part by reducing IL-2 and tumor necrosis factor production by peripheral T lymphocytes. Gene inactivation causes mice (Kv1.3-/-) exposed to a high-fat diet to gain less weight and be less obese than littermate control. Interestingly, although Kv1.3-/- mice on the high-calorie diet gain weight, they remain euglycemic, with low blood insulin levels. This observation prompted us to examine the effect of Kv1.3 gene inactivation and inhibition on peripheral glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Here we show that Kv1.3 gene deletion and channel inhibition increase peripheral insulin sensitivity in vivo . Baseline and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake are increased in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of Kv1.3-/- mice. Inhibition of Kv1.3 activity facilitates the translocation of the glucose transporter, GLUT4, to the plasma membrane. It also suppresses c-JUN terminal kinase activity in fat and skeletal muscle and decreases IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor secretion by adipose tissue. We conclude that Kv1.3 inhibition improves insulin sensitivity by increasing the amount of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane.

Alcohol exposure during this critical period of brain maturation may affect development of PFC and frontolimbic connectivity. Adult rats exposed to adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE; 5 g/kg ethanol, 25 percent v / v in water, intragastrically, 2‐day‐on, 2‐day‐off, postnatal day 25–54) or water control underwent resting‐state functional MRI to test the hypothesis that AIE induces persistent changes in frontolimbic functional connectivity under baseline and acute alcohol conditions (2 g/kg ethanol or saline, intraperitoneally administered during scanning). Data were acquired on a Bruker 9.4‐T MR scanner with rats under dexmedetomidine sedation in combination with isoflurane. Frontolimbic network regions‐of‐interest for data analysis included PFC [prelimbic (PrL), infralimbic (IL), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) portions], nucleus accumbens (NAc), caudate putamen (CPu), dorsal hippocampus, ventral tegmental area, amygdala, and somatosensory forelimb used as a control region. AIE decreased baseline resting‐state connectivity between PFC subregions (PrL‐IL and IL‐OFC) and between PFC‐striatal regions (PrL‐NAc, IL‐CPu, IL‐NAc, OFC‐CPu, and OFC‐NAc). Acute ethanol induced negative blood‐oxygen‐level‐dependent changes within all regions of interest examined, along with significant increases in functional connectivity in control, but not AIE animals. Together, these data support the hypothesis that binge‐like adolescent alcohol exposure causes persistent decreases in baseline frontolimbic (particularly frontostriatal) connectivity and alters sensitivity to acute ethanol‐induced increases in functional connectivity in adulthood."</span>

The α-synuclein protein was expressed in 90–95% of all nigral dopamine neurons and distributed by anterograde transport throughout their axonal and dendritic projections. The transduced neurons developed severe neuronal pathology, including α-synuclein-positive cytoplasmic inclusions and granular deposits; swollen, dystrophic, and fragmented neuritis; and shrunken and pyknotic, densely α-synuclein-positive perikarya. By 16 wk posttransduction, 30–60% of the tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons were lost, and the tyrosine hydroxylase-positive innervation of the caudate nucleus and putamen was reduced to a similar extent. The rAAV-α-synuclein-treated monkeys developed a type of motor impairment, i.e., head position bias, compatible with this magnitude of nigrostriatal damage. rAAV vector-mediated α-synuclein gene transfer provides a transgenic primate model of nigrostriatal α-synucleinopathy that is of particular interest because it develops slowly over time, like human Parkinson's disease (PD), and expresses neuropathological features (α-synuclein-positive inclusions and dystrophic neurites, in particular) that are similar to those seen in idiopathic PD.

We also attempted to identify factors explaining differences in the treatment response. Design. An observational case‐control study. Setting. University Hospital Vulva clinic. Population. Sixty‐six women diagnosed with severe vulvar vestibulitis and treated initially by conservative management during 1994–2005. Thirty‐nine women did not respond and underwent posterior vestibulectomy and 27 were managed without surgery. Methods. Baseline patient characteristics, degree of dyspareunia, and details of management were collected from hospital charts. At the follow‐up visit current dyspareunia, sexual well‐being, somatic and mental health, and social support were analyzed. Vestibular tenderness was measured by swab‐touch test. Main outcome measures. Visual analogue scale for dyspareunia, sexual well‐being, vestibular tenderness , and overall patient satisfaction at follow‐up. Results. Dyspareunia decreased significantly in both groups. The visual analogue scale decreased 66.7% in the surgery group and 78.1% in the conservative treatment group ( p = 0.407). Posterior swab‐touch test was negative more frequently after vestibulectomy. Long‐term sexual well‐being did not differ between the two groups. Overall, 89% of the women in both groups were satisfied with the treatment. Women with atopic skin problems were less likely to need surgery (odds ratio 0.2; 95% confidence interval 0.1–0.7). Conclusion. Women with severe vulvar vestibulitis syndrome who do not respond to conservative management achieve good long‐term well‐being and decrease of dyspareunia by posterior vestibulectomy. The response is comparable to that achieved by conservative management among women who do not need surgery."</span>

Thus, substrate proteins might be part of higher molecular complexes constituted by many proteins with diverse and potentially unknown cellular origin. In cell culture, these may be reconstituted by mixing native secretomes from different cell types prior to incubation with a test protease. Although current degradomics techniques could identify novel substrate proteins in these complexes, all information on the cellular origin is lost. To address this limitation, we combined iTRAQ‐based terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (iTRAQ‐TAILS) with SILAC to assign proteins to a specific cell type by MS1‐ and their cleavage by MS2‐based quantification in the same experiment. We demonstrate the power of our newly established workflow by monitoring matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 10 dependent cleavages in mixtures from light‐labeled keratinocyte and heavy‐labeled fibroblast secretomes. This analysis correctly assigned extracellular matrix components, such as laminins and collagens, to their respective cellular origins and revealed their processing in an MMP10‐dependent manner. Hence, our newly devised degradomics workflow facilitates deeper insight into protease activity in complex intercellular compartments such as the epidermal–dermal interface by integrating multiple modes of quantification with positional proteomics.

However, whether the activation of thermogenic adipocytes affects the metabolism and anti-atherogenic properties of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) is unknown. Here, we report a reduction in atherosclerosis in response to pharmacological stimulation of thermogenesis linked to increased HDL levels in APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice. Both cold-induced and pharmacological thermogenic activation enhances HDL remodelling, which is associated with specific lipidomic changes in mouse and human HDL. Furthermore, thermogenic stimulation promotes HDL-cholesterol clearance and increases macrophage-to-faeces reverse cholesterol transport in mice. Mechanistically, we show that intravascular lipolysis by adipocyte lipoprotein lipase and hepatic uptake of HDL by scavenger receptor B-I are the driving forces of HDL-cholesterol disposal in liver. Our findings corroborate the notion that high metabolic activity of thermogenic adipocytes confers atheroprotective properties via increased systemic cholesterol flux through the HDL compartment."</span>

In two cell types, the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 and BHK cells double transfected with cDNA's encoding for the human CD-MPR and CI-MPR, we found the two receptors at the same sites: the trans-Golgi reticulum (TGR), endosomes, electron-dense cytoplasmic vesicles, and the plasma membrane. In the TGR the two receptors colocalized and were concentrated to the same extent in the same HA I-adaptor positive coated buds and vesicles. Endosomes were identified by the presence of exogenous tracers. The two MPR codistributed to the same endosomes, but semiquantitative analysis showed a relative enrichment of the CI-MPR in endosomes containing many internal vesicles. Two endosomal subcompartments were discerned, the central vacuole and the associated tubules and vesicles (ATV). We found an enrichment of CD-MPR over CI-MPR in the ATV. Lateral segregation of the two receptors within the plane of membranes was also detected on isolated organelles. Double immunolabeling for the CD-MPR and the asialoglycoprotein receptor, which mainly recycles between endosomes and the plasma membrane, revealed that these two receptors were concentrated in different subpopulations of endosomal ATV. The small GTP-binding protein rab4, which has been shown to mediate recycling from endosomes to the plasma membrane, was localized at the cytosolic face of many endosomal ATV. Quantitative analysis of double-immunolabeled cells revealed only a limited codistribution of the MPRs and rab4 in ATV. These data suggest that the two MPRs exit the TGR via the same coated vesicles, but that upon arrival in the endosomes CD-MPR is more rapidly than CI-MPR, segregated into ATV which probably are destined to recycle MPRs to TGR."</span>

We investigated the role of the proapoptotic molecule TRAIL in this defect. We first demonstrate that TRAIL does not contribute to the CD8+ T cell response to Listeria monocytogenes strain expressing OVA (LmOVA) in the presence of CD4+ T cells. Secondly, we generated mice doubly deficient in CD4+ T cells and TRAIL and analyzed their CD8+ T cell response to LmOVA. Memory CD8+ T cells in double-deficient mice waned over time and were not protective against rechallenge, similar to their TRAIL-sufficient unhelped counterparts. To avoid the effects of CD4+ T cell deficiency during memory maintenance, and to address whether TRAIL plays a role in the early programming of the CD8+ T cell response, we performed experiments using heterologous prime and early boost immunizations. We did not observe activation-induced cell death of unhelped CD8+ T cells when mice were infected with followed vaccinia virus expressing OVA 9 days later by LmOVA infection. Furthermore, primary immunization of CD4+ T cell-deficient mice with cell-associated Ag followed by LmOVA infection did not reveal a role for TRAIL-mediated activation-induced cell death.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"ABSTRACT PINCH is a widely expressed and evolutionarily conserved protein comprising primarily five LIM domains, which are cysteine-rich consensus sequences implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions. We report here that PINCH is a binding protein for integrin-linked kinase (ILK), an intracellular serine/threonine protein kinase that plays important roles in the cell adhesion, growth factor, and Wnt signaling pathways. The interaction between ILK and PINCH has been consistently observed under a variety of experimental conditions. They have interacted in yeast two-hybrid assays, in solution, and in solid-phase-based binding assays. Furthermore, ILK, but not vinculin or focal adhesion kinase, has been coisolated with PINCH from mammalian cells by immunoaffinity chromatography, indicating that PINCH and ILK associate with each other in vivo. The PINCH-ILK interaction is mediated by the N-terminal-most LIM domain (LIM1, residues 1 to 70) of PINCH and multiple ankyrin (ANK) repeats located within the N-terminal domain (residues 1 to 163) of ILK. Additionally, biochemical studies indicate that ILK, through the interaction with PINCH, is capable of forming a ternary complex with Nck-2, an SH2/SH3-containing adapter protein implicated in growth factor receptor kinase and small GTPase signaling pathways. Finally, we have found that PINCH is concentrated in peripheral ruffles of cells spreading on fibronectin and have detected clusters of PINCH that are colocalized with the α5β1 integrins. These results demonstrate a specific protein recognition mechanism utilizing a specific LIM domain and multiple ANK repeats and suggest that PINCH functions as an adapter protein connecting ILK and the integrins with components of growth factor receptor kinase and small GTPase signaling pathways."</span>

Whilst numerical models have shed light on the nature of climate at the time, uncertainties in their predictions have not been systematically examined. The Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project quantifies uncertainties in model outputs through a coordinated multi-model and multi-model/data intercomparison. Whilst commonalities in model outputs for the Pliocene are clearly evident, we show substantial variation in the sensitivity of models to the implementation of Pliocene boundary conditions. Models appear able to reproduce many regional changes in temperature reconstructed from geological proxies. However, data/model comparison highlights that models potentially underestimate polar amplification. To assert this conclusion with greater confidence, limitations in the time-averaged proxy data currently available must be addressed. Furthermore, sensitivity tests exploring the known unknowns in modelling Pliocene climate specifically relevant to the high latitudes are essential (e.g. palaeogeography, gateways, orbital forcing and trace gasses). Estimates of longer-term sensitivity to CO2 (also known as Earth System Sensitivity; ESS), support previous work suggesting that ESS is greater than Climate Sensitivity (CS), and suggest that the ratio of ESS to CS is between 1 and 2, with a "best" estimate of 1.5."</span>

Methods: A population-based, retrospective, observational study was performed, using the National Swedish Hospital and Cause of Death Registers, covering the period from 1987–2001. After a diagnosis of Addison’s disease, each patient was followed until the end of follow-up or death. Mortality was compared with that of the Swedish background population. Findings: We identified 1675 patients (995 women and 680 men) diagnosed with primary adrenal insufficiency. The average follow-up from initial diagnosis was 6.5 yr. Five hundred seven patients died during the study period compared with an expected 199. The risk ratio for all-cause mortality was 2.19 (confidence interval 1.91–2.51) for men and 2.86 (confidence interval 2.54–3.20) for women. The excess mortality in both men and women was attributed to cardiovascular, malignant, and infectious diseases. Concomitant diabetes mellitus was observed in 12% of the patients, but only contributed to the increased mortality to a minor extent. Interpretation: Compared with the background population, we observed that the risk ratio for death was more than 2-fold higher in patients with Addison’s disease. Cardiovascular, malignant, and infectious diseases were responsible for the higher mortality rate."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract To evaluate the importance of the thymus for the reconstitution of immunity in recipients of a T-cell–depleted bone marrow, we measured the appearance of CD4+CD45RA+RO−naive T cells (thymic rebound), restoration of the diversity of the T-cell–receptor (TCR) repertoire and the response to vaccinations with tetanus toxoid (TT). Repopulation by CD4+CD45RA+RO− thymic emigrants varied among patients, starting at approximately 6 months after transplantation. Young patients reconstituted swiftly, whereas in older patients, the recovery of normal numbers of naive CD4+ T cells could take several years. Restoration of TCR diversity was correlated with the number of naive CD4+CD45RA+RO− T cells. Moreover, the extent of the thymic rebound correlated with the patient's capacity to respond to vaccinations. Patients without a significant thymic rebound at the moment of vaccination (CD4+CD45RA+RO− T cells less than 30 μL) did not respond, or responded only marginally even after 3 boosts with TT. We conclude that during the first year after transplantation, the absence of an immune response is due mainly to the loss of an adequate T-cell repertoire. Restoration of the repertoire can come only from a thymic rebound that can be monitored by measuring the increase of CD4+CD45RA+RO−naive T cells. This will allow postponing revaccinations to a moment when the patient will be able to respond more effectively. This may be particularly useful in the elderly patient who, owing to low thymic activity, might not yet be able to respond 1 year after transplant when revaccinations are usually scheduled."</span>

In this paper, it is shown that whereas pre-existing memory T cells appear relatively early after bone-marrow transplantation, 2–3 years after transplantation, naive T cells with a broad TCR repertoire appear. Together with reference 119 , these data imply that after chemotherapy and bone-marrow transplantation, the thymus of some adults can produce new T cells eventually.
This study demonstrates a correlation between thymic rebound (measured by CD4+CD45RA+RO− T cells) and the capacity to mount a response to vaccination following T-cell depleted bone marrow transplantation.

Radiation has been postulated to target epithelial stem cells within the crypts of Lieberkühn to initiate the lethal GI syndrome. Here, we show in mouse models that microvascular endothelial apoptosis is the primary lesion leading to stem cell dysfunction. Radiation-induced crypt damage, organ failure, and death from the GI syndrome were prevented when endothelial apoptosis was inhibited pharmacologically by intravenous basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or genetically by deletion of the acid sphingomyelinase gene. Endothelial, but not crypt, cells express FGF receptor transcripts, suggesting that the endothelial lesion occurs before crypt stem cell damage in the evolution of the GI syndrome.

Yet, these perspectives have so far been hindered by the absence of spatial selectivity of existing acoustical tweezers - i.e., the ability to select and move objects individually - and/or their limited resolution restricting their use to large particle manipulation only and/or finally the limited forces that they could apply. Here, we report precise selective manipulation and positioning of individual human cells in a standard microscopy environment with trapping forces up to ~200 pN without altering their viability.

E. coli O157 causes a wide range of clinical illness that varies by outbreak, although factors that contribute to variation in disease severity are poorly understood. Several recent outbreaks involving O157 contamination of fresh produce (e.g., spinach) were associated with more severe disease, as defined by higher hemolytic uremic syndrome and hospitalization frequencies, suggesting that increased virulence has evolved. To test this hypothesis, we developed a system that detects SNPs in 96 loci and applied it to &gt;500 E. coli O157 clinical strains. Phylogenetic analyses identified 39 SNP genotypes that differ at 20% of SNP loci and are separated into nine distinct clades. Differences were observed between clades in the frequency and distribution of Shiga toxin genes and in the type of clinical disease reported. Patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome were significantly more likely to be infected with clade 8 strains, which have increased in frequency over the past 5 years. Genome sequencing of a spinach outbreak strain, a member of clade 8, also revealed substantial genomic differences. These findings suggest that an emergent subpopulation of the clade 8 lineage has acquired critical factors that contribute to more severe disease. The ability to detect and rapidly genotype O157 strains belonging to such lineages is important and will have a significant impact on both disease diagnosis and treatment guidelines."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Cancer metastasis is a complex process involving many genes and pathways. This complexity hinders the identification of molecules functionally required for this process. We have developed and used a Drosophila screening system to identify genes that are functionally important for tumorigenicity and metastasis. Deletion of Drosophila lethal giant larvae ( l(2)gl ) leads to highly invasive and widely metastatic tumors on transplantation into adult flies. Random homozygous P element insertions were screened for the ability to modulate the l(2)gl phenotype. Analysis of metastasis patterns of the lines containing P element insertions and lacking wild-type l(2)gl expression identified three homozygous mutations that dramatically alter tumorigenesis and/or metastasis. Semaphorin 5c ( Sema 5c ) is required for tumorigenicity, apontic overexpression suppresses metastasis but not tumorigenicity, and pointed up-regulation accelerates lethality of l(2)gl tumors. Furthermore, class 5 semaphorins are shown to be expressed in cancer cells and localized to the membrane. Drosophila Sema-5c and the mammalian homologs are transmembrane proteins with extracellular thrombospondin type I (TspI) repeats. TspI repeats are known in some proteins to bind and activate transforming growth factor (TGF)-β ligand. Phospho-Mad and the downstream target gene vestigial were elevated in l(2)gl tumors, thus linking Drosophila neoplasia to the Dpp (TGF-β-like) signal pathway. The activation of the Dpp pathway in l(2)gl tumors occurred only in the presence of Sema-5c.

The mechanisms underlying these diverse outcomes are poorly understood. In particular, the role played by cells of the innate immune system, such as dendritic cells (DC), is not known. In this study, we show that Ebola and Lassa viruses infect human monocyte-derived DC and impair their function. Monocyte-derived DC exposed to either virus fail to secrete proinflammatory cytokines, do not up-regulate costimulatory molecules, and are poor stimulators of T cells. These data represent the first evidence for a mechanism by which Ebola and Lassa viruses target DC to impair adaptive immunity."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is required to generate ventral cell types throughout the central nervous system. Its role in directly specifying ventral cells,however, has recently been questioned because loss of the Shh gene has little effect on ventral development if the Gli3 gene is also mutant. Consequently, another ventral determinant must exist. Here, genetic evidence establishes that FGFs are required for ventral telencephalon development. First, simultaneous deletion of Fgfr1 and Fgfr3specifically in the telencephalon results in the loss of differentiated ventromedial cells; and second, in the Fgfr1;Fgfr2 double mutant, ventral precursor cells are lost, mimicking the phenotype obtained previously with a loss of SHH signalling. Yet, in the Fgfr1;Fgfr2 mutant, Shh remains expressed, as does Gli1, the transcription of which depends on SHH activity, suggesting that FGF signalling acts independently of SHH to generate ventral precursors. Moreover, the Fgfr1;Fgfr2 phenotype, unlike the Shhphenotype, is not rescued by loss of Gli3, further indicating that FGFs act downstream of Shh and Gli3 to generate ventral telencephalic cell types."</span>

To determine how the Tim23 protein itself is transported into mitochondria, we used chemical cross-linking to identify proteins adjacent to Tim23p during its biogenesis. In the absence of an inner membrane potential, Tim23p is translocated across the mitochondrial outer membrane, but not inserted into the inner membrane. At this intermediate stage, we find that Tim23p forms cross-linked products with two distinct protein complexes of the intermembrane space, Tim8p–Tim13p and Tim9p–Tim10p. Tim9p and Tim10p cross-link to the COOH-terminal domain of the Tim23 protein, which carries all of the targeting signals for Tim23p. Therefore, our results suggest that the Tim9p–Tim10p complex plays a key role in Tim23p import. In contrast, Tim8p and Tim13p cross-link to the hydrophilic NH2-terminal segment of Tim23p, which does not carry essential import information and, thus, the role of Tim8p–Tim13p is unclear. Tim23p contains two matrix-facing, positively charged loops that are essential for its insertion into the inner membrane. The positive charges are not required for interaction with the Tim9p–Tim10p complex, but are essential for cross-linking of Tim23p to components of the inner membrane insertion machinery, including Tim54p, Tim22p, and Tim12p."</span>

These invariant NK T cells can regulate diverse immune responses in mice, including antitumor responses, through mechanisms including rapid production of IL-4 and IFN-γ, but their physiological functions remain uncertain. Invariant NK T cells were markedly decreased in peripheral blood from advanced prostate cancer patients, and their ex vivo expansion with a CD1d-presented lipid Ag (α-galactosylceramide) was diminished compared with healthy donors. Invariant NK T cells from healthy donors produced high levels of both IFN-γ and IL-4. In contrast, whereas invariant NK T cells from prostate cancer patients also produced IL-4, they had diminished IFN-γ production and a striking decrease in their IFN-γ:IL-4 ratio. The IFN-γ deficit was specific to the invariant NK T cells, as bulk T cells from prostate cancer patients produced normal levels of IFN-γ and IL-4. These findings support an immunoregulatory function for invariant NK T cells in humans mediated by differential production of Th1 vs Th2 cytokines.

The wild-type caspase recruitment domain of Apaf-1 was used as a dominant negative inhibitor of Apaf-1 (rAAV-Apaf-1-DN-EGFP). An AAV virus vector was used to deliver it into the striatum of C57 black mice, and the animals were treated with MPTP. The number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra was not changed on the rAAV-Apaf-1-DN-EGFP injected side compared with the noninjected side. We also examined the effect of a caspase 1 C285G mutant as a dominant negative inhibitor of caspase 1 (rAAV-caspase-1-DN-EGFP) in the same model. However, there was no difference in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons between the rAAV-caspase-1-DN-EGFP injected side and the noninjected side. These results indicate that delivery of Apaf-1-DN by using an AAV vector system can prevent nigrostriatal degeneration in MPTP mice, suggesting that it could be a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with Parkinson's disease.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Fsp27 is a lipid droplet-associated protein almost exclusively expressed in adipocytes where it facilitates unilocular lipid droplet formation. In mice, Fsp27 deficiency is associated with increased basal lipolysis, ‘browning’ of white fat and a healthy metabolic profile, whereas a patient with congenital CIDEC deficiency manifested an adverse lipodystrophic phenotype. Here we reconcile these data by showing that exposing Fsp27 -null mice to a substantial energetic stress by crossing them with ob/ob mice or BATless mice, or feeding them a high-fat diet, results in hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. We also observe a striking reduction in adipose inflammation and increase in adiponectin levels in all three models. This appears to reflect reduced activation of the inflammasome and less adipocyte death. These findings highlight the importance of Fsp27 in facilitating optimal energy storage in adipocytes and represent a rare example where adipose inflammation and hepatic insulin resistance are disassociated."</span>

We demonstrate that Th17 cells also expressed IL-22, an IL-10 family member, at substantially higher amounts than T helper (Th)1 or Th2 cells. Similar to IL-17A, IL-22 expression was initiated by transforming growth factor β signaling in the context of IL-6 and other proinflammatory cytokines. The subsequent expansion of IL-22–producing cells was dependent on IL-23. We further demonstrate that IL-22 was coexpressed in vitro and in vivo with both IL-17A and IL-17F. To study a functional relationship among these cytokines, we examined the expression of antimicrobial peptides by primary keratinocytes treated with combinations of IL-22, IL-17A, and IL-17F. IL-22 in conjunction with IL-17A or IL-17F synergistically induced the expression of β-defensin 2 and S100A9 and additively enhanced the expression of S100A7 and S100A8.

Three of the six monkeys then received stereotaxically guided bilateral mamillary body lesions, leaving the fornix intact, while the other three received a control operation. Postoperatively the control animals' rate of learning new scenes was unchanged, but the animals with mamillary body lesions showed a severe impairment, equal to that seen in previous experiments after fornix transection. All six animals were then given fornix transection, in addition to the existing mamillary or control operation. The control group now showed, after fornix transection, an impairment equal to that of the animals with mamillary body lesions alone. But the animals with mamillary body lesions did not show any additional impairment following fornix transection. We conclude that (1) the role of the mamillary bodies in a model of human episodic memory is as important as the role of the fornix, (2) the fornix and mamillary bodies form a single functional memory system, since the effect of lesions in both parts is no more severe than the effects of a lesion in one of the parts alone, and (3) the idea that the functional effects of fornix transection result from cholmergic deafferentation of the hippocampus receives no support from the present results; rather, they support the idea that in primates the fornix and mamillary bodies, together with connected structures, including the subiculum, mamillo-thalamic tract, anterior thalamic nuclei, and cingulate bundle, form a cortico-cortical association pathway for episodic memory."</span>

In cultured cells, SUMOylation stabilizes Httex1p, reduces its ability to form aggregates, and promotes its capacity to repress transcription. In a Drosophila model of HD, SUMOylation of Httex1p exacerbates neurodegeneration, whereas ubiquitination of Httex1p abrogates neurodegeneration.

Mutations in TERC are linked to human diseases, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.

Dyskeratosis congenita (DC)-related TERC U100A mutation impair the association of HuR with TERC , thereby reducing C106 methylation. Two other TERC mutations linked to aplastic anemia and autosomal dominant DC, G107U, and GC107/108AG, likewise disrupt methylation at C106. Loss-of-HuR binding and hence lower TERC methylation leads to decreased telomerase activity and telomere shortening. Furthermore, HuR deficiency or mutation of mTERC HuR binding or methylation sites impair the renewal of mouse hematopoietic stem cells, recapitulating the bone marrow failure seen in DC.

More than a century of stimulation, anatomical and electrophysiological studies has implicated neural activity in this region with all kinds of movement. However, following the removal of motor cortex, rats retain most of their adaptive behaviours, including previously learned skilled movements. Here we revisit these two conflicting views of motor cortex and present a new behaviour assay, challenging animals to respond to unexpected situations while navigating a dynamic obstacle course. Surprisingly, rats with motor cortical lesions show clear impairments facing an unexpected collapse of the obstacles, while showing no impairment with repeated trials in many motor and cognitive metrics of performance. We propose a new role for motor cortex: extending the robustness of sub-cortical movement systems, specifically to unexpected situations demanding rapid motor responses adapted to environmental context.

Soroldoni et al. propose a similar event during the formation of vertebrate embryo body segments. It is generally thought that the internal timing of a genetic oscillator called the “segmentation clock” sets the rhythm of body segments called somites. However, time-lapse microscopy of the spatial waves of oscillations and the timing of body segment formation showed segments forming faster than spatial genetic oscillations. This “Doppler effect” occurs because the end of the oscillating tissue moves steadily into the oncoming waves. Thus, the rhythm of sequential body segmentation is a function of genetic oscillations, their changing wave pattern, and tissue shortening. Science , this issue p. 222"</span>

This family is characterized by direct repeats, varying in size from 21 to 37 bp, interspaced by similarly sized non‐repetitive sequences. To appreciate their characteri‐stic structure, we will refer to this family as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). In most species with two or more CRISPR loci, these loci were flanked on one side by a common leader sequence of 300–500 b. The direct repeats and the leader sequences were conserved within a species, but dissimilar between species. The presence of multiple chromosomal CRISPR loci suggests that CRISPRs are mobile elements. Four CRISPR‐associated ( cas ) genes were identified in CRISPR‐containing prokaryotes that were absent from CRISPR‐negative prokaryotes. The cas genes were invariably located adjacent to a CRISPR locus, indicating that the cas genes and CRISPR loci have a functional relationship. The cas3 gene showed motifs characteristic for helicases of the superfamily 2, and the cas 4 gene showed motifs of the RecB family of exonucleases, suggesting that these genes are involved in DNA metabolism or gene expression. The spatial coherence of CRISPR and cas genes may stimulate new research on the genesis and biological role of these repeats and genes."</span>

Neurons containing the peptide precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) are found at two sites in the brain, the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) and the caudal region of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). ARC POMC neurons, which also express cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), are known to mediate part of the response to factors regulating energy homeostasis, such as leptin and ghrelin. In contrast, the physiological role(s) of the POMC neurons in the caudal brainstem are not well characterized. However, development of a transgenic mouse expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of the POMC promoter [POMC-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) mouse] has aided the study of these neurons. Indeed, recent studies have shown significant activation of NTS POMC-EGFP cells by the gut released satiety factor cholecystokinin (CCK). Here we show that peripheral leptin administration induces the expression of phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 immunoreactivity (pSTAT3-IR), a marker of leptin receptor signaling, in more than 50% of NTS POMC-EGFP neurons. Furthermore, these POMC-EGFP neurons comprise 30% of all pSTAT3-IR cells in the NTS. Additionally, we also show that in contrast to the ARC population, NTS POMC-EGFP neurons do not coexpress CART immunoreactivity. These data suggest that NTS POMC neurons may participate with ARC POMC cells in mediating some of the effects of leptin and thus comprise a novel cell group regulated by both long-term adipostatic signals and satiety factors such as CCK."</span>

Interestingly, RACK1 is also a constituent of the eukaryotic ribosome, and a recent cryo‐electron microscopy study localized it to the head region of the 40S subunit in the vicinity of the messenger RNA (mRNA) exit channel. RACK1 recruits activated protein kinase C to the ribosome, which leads to the stimulation of translation through the phosphorylation of initiation factor 6 and, potentially, of mRNA‐associated proteins. RACK1 therefore links signal‐transduction pathways directly to the ribosome, which allows translation to be regulated in response to cell stimuli.

One particular Opa protein mediates adherence to epithelial cells through cell surface proteoglycans. Recently, two other eukaryotic cell receptors for Opa proteins have been reported. These receptors are members of a subgroup of the carcinoembryonic (CEA) gene family that express CD66 antigens. CEA family members vary in their distribution in human tissues. In order to understand whether interactions between Opa and CEA-like molecules play any role in pathogenesis, we must investigate which CEA family members are able to serve as Opa receptors and which Opa proteins recognize CEA-like molecules. We therefore studied HeLa cells that were stably transfected with five different members of the CEA family, i.e., CEA, CEA gene family member 1a (CGM1a), CGM6, nonspecific cross-reacting antigen (NCA), and biliary glycoprotein a (BGPa). We infected these transfectants with all possible 11 Opa variants of gonococcal strain MS11 and determined the numbers of bacteria that were bound and internalized. To account for proteoglycan-mediated adherence, infection assays were also performed in the presence of heparin. Our results show that of the 11 Opa variants of MS11, the same 4 recognized CGM1a and NCA. CGM6, however, was not recognized by any Opa variant of MS11. CEA was recognized by at least 9 of 11 Opa variants, and the BGP transfectants specifically bound and internalized 10 of 11 Opa variants and also bound Opa-negative gonococci. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that clustering of CEA-like molecules occurred upon infection of HeLa transfectants with those Opa variants that interacted specifically with the CEA family member. Together these data show that CEA family members are differentially recognized by gonococcal Opa variants, suggesting that this phenomenon may contribute to cell tropism displayed by gonococci."</span>

In G . sulfurreducens , the omcB gene is part of two tandem four‐gene clusters, each is predicted to encode a transcriptional factor ( OrfR / OrfS ), a porin‐like outer membrane protein ( OmbB / OmbC ), a periplasmic c‐ type cytochrome ( OmaB / OmaC ) and an outer membrane c ‐ C yt ( OmcB / OmcC ) respectively. Here, we showed that OmbB / OmbC , OmaB / OmaC and OmcB / OmcC of G . sulfurreducens PCA formed the porin‐cytochrome ( P cc) protein complexes, which were involved in transferring electrons across the outer membrane. The isolated P cc protein complexes reconstituted in proteoliposomes transferred electrons from reduced methyl viologen across the lipid bilayer of liposomes to F e( III )‐citrate and ferrihydrite.

The acquired genetic instability and associated selection process, most readily recognized cytogenetically, results in advanced human malignancies being highly individual karyotypically and biologically. Hence, each patient's cancer may require individual specific therapy, and even this may be thwarted by emergence of a genetically variant subline resistant to the treatment.

SCO2 is critical for regulating the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) complex, the major site of oxygen utilization in the eukaryotic cell. Disruption of the SCO2 gene in human cancer cells with wild-type p53 recapitulated the metabolic switch toward glycolysis that is exhibited by p53-deficient cells.

We identify the region of cyclin B2 responsible for its localization and show that this will direct cyclin B1 to the Golgi apparatus and confer upon it the more limited properties of cyclin B2. Equally, directing cyclin B2 to the cytoplasm with the NH2 terminus of cyclin B1 confers the broader properties of cyclin B1.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies suppress immune responses by transient T-cell depletion and antigenic modulation of the CD3/T-cell receptor complex. Anti-CD3 treatment of adult nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, a spontaneous model of T-cell-mediated autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, significantly inhibits the autoimmune process. Short-term low-dose anti-CD3 treatment (5 micrograms/day i.v. for 5 consecutive days) prevented the occurrence of an accelerated form of the disease induced by cyclophosphamide. More unexpectedly, when applied to adult NOD females within 7 days of the onset of full-blown diabetes, the same anti-CD3 regimen induced a complete remission of overt disease (i.e., a return to permanent normoglycemia) in 64-80% of mice. This remission was durable (&gt; 4 months) and was not associated with the disappearance of insulitis (mononuclear cell infiltration of the islets). The immunosuppression was apparently specific for beta-cell-associated antigens, since mice showing anti-CD3-induced remission rejected histoincompatible skin grafts normally, whereas they did not destroy syngeneic islet grafts, unlike control untreated overtly diabetic NOD females. These results open major therapeutic perspectives. They strongly suggest that self-tolerance can be restored in adult mice once autoimmunity is fully established and confirm that this effect can be obtained by transient targeting of the CD3/T-cell receptor without massive T-cell debulking."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis ( Bd ) is a globally ubiquitous fungal infection that has emerged to become a primary driver of amphibian biodiversity loss. Despite widespread effort to understand the emergence of this panzootic, the origins of the infection, its patterns of global spread, and principle mode of evolution remain largely unknown. Using comparative population genomics, we discovered three deeply diverged lineages of Bd associated with amphibians. Two of these lineages were found in multiple continents and are associated with known introductions by the amphibian trade. We found that isolates belonging to one clade, the global panzootic lineage ( Bd GPL) have emerged across at least five continents during the 20th century and are associated with the onset of epizootics in North America, Central America, the Caribbean, Australia, and Europe. The two newly identified divergent lineages, Cape lineage ( Bd CAPE) and Swiss lineage ( Bd CH), were found to differ in morphological traits when compared against one another and Bd GPL, and we show that Bd GPL is hypervirulent. Bd GPL uniquely bears the hallmarks of genomic recombination, manifested as extensive intergenomic phylogenetic conflict and patchily distributed heterozygosity. We postulate that contact between previously genetically isolated allopatric populations of Bd may have allowed recombination to occur, resulting in the generation, spread, and invasion of the hypervirulent Bd GPL leading to contemporary disease-driven losses in amphibian biodiversity."</span>

Activated myosin IIB localizes prominently at the cell rear and produces large, stable actin filament bundles and adhesions, which locally inhibit protrusion and define the morphology of the tail. Myosin IIA forms de novo filaments away from the myosin IIB–enriched center and back to form regions that support protrusion. The positioning and dynamics of myosin IIA and IIB depend on the self-assembly regions in their coiled-coil C terminus. COS7 and B16 melanoma cells lack myosin IIA and IIB, respectively; and show isoform-specific front-back polarity in migrating cells.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"In the big brown bat ( Eptesicus fuscus), conditioning with acoustic stimuli followed by electric leg-stimulation causes shifts in frequency-tuning curves and best frequencies (hereafter BF shifts) of collicular and cortical neurons, i.e., reorganization of the cochleotopic (frequency) maps in the inferior colliculus (IC) and auditory cortex (AC). The collicular BF shift recovers 180 min after the conditioning, but the cortical BF shift lasts longer than 26 h. The collicular BF shift is not caused by conditioning, as the AC is inactivated during conditioning. Therefore it has been concluded that the collicular BF shift is caused by the corticofugal auditory system. The collicular and cortical BF shifts both are not caused by conditioning as the somatosensory cortex is inactivated during conditioning. Therefore it has been hypothesized that the cortical BF shift is mostly caused by both the subcortical (e.g., collicular) BF shift and the activity of nonauditory systems such as the somatosensory cortex excited by an unconditioned leg-stimulation and the cholinergic basal forebrain. The main aims of our present studies are to examine whether acetylcholine (ACh) applied to the AC augments the collicular and cortical BF shifts caused by the conditioning and whether atropine applied to the AC abolishes the cortical BF shift but not the collicular BF shift, as expected from the preceding hypothesis. In the awake bat, we made the following findings. ACh applied to the AC augments not only the cortical BF shift but also the collicular BF shift through the corticofugal system. Atropine applied to the AC reduces the collicular BF shift and abolishes the cortical BF shift which otherwise would be caused. ACh applied to the IC significantly augments the collicular BF shift but affects the cortical BF shift only slightly. ACh makes the cortical BF shift long-lasting beyond 4 h, but it cannot make the collicular BF shift long-lasting beyond 3 h. Atropine applied to the IC abolishes the collicular BF shift. It reduces the cortical BF shift but does not abolish it. Our findings favor the hypothesis that the BF shifts evoked by the corticofugal system, and an increased ACh level in the AC evoked by the basal forebrain are both necessary to evoke a long-lasting cortical BF shift."</span>

To disentangle whether this involves distinct modes of deposition or unique functions once incorporated into chromatin, we combined studies in Xenopus early development with chromatin assays. Here we investigate the extent to which H3.3 mutated at residues that differ from H3.2 rescue developmental defects caused by H3.3 depletion. Regardless of the deposition pathway, only variants at residue 31—a serine that can become phosphorylated—failed to rescue endogenous H3.3 depletion. Although an alanine substitution fails to rescue H3.3 depletion, a phospho-mimic aspartate residue at position 31 rescues H3.3 function. To explore mechanisms involving H3.3 S31 phosphorylation, we identified factors attracted or repulsed by the presence of aspartate at position 31, along with modifications on neighboring residues. We propose that serine 31-phosphorylated H3.3 acts as a signaling module that stimulates the acetylation of K27, providing a chromatin state permissive to the embryonic development program."</span>

Recent studies applied the RT-QuIC methodology to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for diagnosing human prion diseases. However, to date, there has not been a formal multi-centre assessment of the reproducibility, validity and stability of RT-QuIC in this context, an indispensable step for establishment as a diagnostic test in clinical practice. In the present study, we analysed CSF from 110 prion disease patients and 400 control patients using the RT-QuIC method under various conditions. In addition, “blinded” ring trials between different participating sites were performed to estimate reproducibility. Using the previously established cut-off of 10,000 relative fluorescence units (rfu), we obtained a sensitivity of 85 % and a specificity of 99 %. The multi-centre inter-laboratory reproducibility of RT-QuIC revealed a Fleiss’ kappa value of 0.83 (95 % CI: 0.40–1.00) indicating an almost perfect agreement. Moreover, we investigated the impact of short-term CSF storage at different temperatures, long-term storage, repeated freezing and thawing cycles and the contamination of CSF with blood on the RT-QuIC seeding response. Our data indicated that the PrP Sc seed in CSF is stable to any type of storage condition but sensitive to contaminations with blood (&gt;1250 erythrocytes/μL), which results in a false negative RT-QuIC response. Fresh blood-contaminated samples (3 days) can be rescued by removal of erythrocytes. The present study underlines the reproducibility and high stability of RT-QuIC across various CSF storage conditions with a remarkable sensitivity and specificity, suggesting RT-QuIC as an innovative and robust diagnostic method."</span>

Evidence from several systems suggests that Aurora B is physically associated with inner centromere protein (INCENP) in mitosis and has genetic interactions with Survivin. It is unclear whether the Aurora B and INCENP interaction is cell cycle regulated and if Survivin physically interacts in this complex. In this study, we cloned theXenopus Survivin gene, examined its association with Aurora B and INCENP, and determined the effect of its binding on Aurora B kinase activity. We demonstrate that in the Xenopusearly embryo, all of the detectable Survivin is in a complex with both Aurora B and INCENP throughout the cell cycle. Survivin and Aurora B bind different domains on INCENP. Aurora B activity is stimulated &gt;10-fold in mitotic extracts; this activation is phosphatase sensitive, and the binding of Survivin is required for full Aurora B activity.

Field potentials and unit activity were recorded by multiple site silicon probes (5- and 16-site shanks) and wire electrode arrays. Gamma waves were highly coherent along the long axis of the dentate hilus, but average coherence decreased rapidly in the CA3 and CA1 directions. Analysis of short epochs revealed large fluctuations in coherence values between the dentate and CA1 gamma waves. Current source density analysis revealed large sinks and sources in the dentate gyrus with spatial distribution similar to the dipoles evoked by stimulation of the perforant path. The frequency changes of gamma and theta waves positively correlated (40–100 Hz and 5–10 Hz, respectively). Putative interneurons in the dentate gyrus discharged at gamma frequency and were phase-locked to the ascending part of the gamma waves recorded from the hilus. Following bilateral lesion of the entorhinal cortex the power and frequency of hilar gamma activity significantly decreased or disappeared. Instead, a large amplitude but slower gamma pattern (25–50 Hz) emerged in the CA3-CA1 network. We suggest that gamma oscillation emerges from an interaction between intrinsic oscillatory properties of interneurons and the network properties of the dentate gyrus.

In these collaborative environments, lymphocytes scan the surfaces of antigen‐presenting cells for cognate antigens, while moving along stromal networks. The cell‐cell interactions between stromal and hematopoietic cells in SLO s are therefore integral to the normal functioning of these tissues. Not only do stromal cells physically construct SLO architecture but they are essential for regulating hematopoietic populations within these domains. Stromal cells interact closely with lymphocytes and dendritic cells, providing scaffolds on which these cells migrate, and recruiting them into niches by secreting chemokines. Within lymph nodes, stromal cell‐ensheathed conduit networks transport small antigens deep into the SLO parenchyma. More recently, stromal cells have been found to induce peripheral CD 8 + T‐cell tolerance and control the extent to which newly activated T cells proliferate within lymph nodes. Thus, stromal‐hematopoietic crosstalk has important consequences for regulating immune cell function within SLO s. In addition, stromal cell interactions with hematopoietic cells, other stroma, and the inflammatory milieu have profound effects on key stromal functions.

When this is modified so that the fitness increases linearly over a range of one or two standard deviations of the value of the selected character, the efficiency is reduced, but not greatly. When truncation selection is compared to a system in which fitness is strictly proportional to the character value, the relative efficiency of truncation selection is given by f(c)/σ , in which f(c) is the ordinate of the frequency distribution at the truncation point and σ is the standard deviation of the character. It is shown, for mutations affecting viability in Drosophila , that truncation selection or reasonable departures therefrom can reduce the mutation load greatly. This may be one way to reconcile the very high mutation rate of such genes with a small mutation load. The truncation model with directional selection is appropriate for this situation because of the approximate additivity of these mutations. On the other hand, it is doubtful that this simple model can be applied to all genes affecting fitness, for which there are intermediate optima and antagonistic selection among components with negative correlations.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Why do certain proteins evolve much slower than others? We compared not only rates per protein, but also rates per position within individual proteins. For ∼90% of proteins, the distribution of positional rates exhibits three peaks: a peak of slow evolving residues, with average log 2 [normalized rate], log 2 μ, of ca. −2, corresponding primarily to core residues; a peak of fast evolving residues (log 2 μ ∼ 0.5) largely corresponding to surface residues; and a very fast peak (log 2 μ ∼ 2) associated with disordered segments. However, a unique fraction of proteins that evolve very slowly exhibit not only a negligible fast peak, but also a peak with a log 2 μ ∼ −4, rather than the standard core peak of −2. Thus, a “freeze” of a protein's surface seems to stop core evolution as well. We also observed a much higher fraction of substitutions in potentially interacting residues than expected by chance, including substitutions in pairs of contacting surface-core residues. Overall, the data suggest that accumulation of surface substitutions enables the acceptance of substitutions in core positions. The underlying reason for slow evolution might therefore be a highly constrained surface due to protein–protein interactions or the need to prevent misfolding or aggregation. If the surface is inaccessible to substitutions, so becomes the core, thus resulting in very slow overall rates."</span>

While natural Abs to apoptotic cells in naive adult mice were dominated by PC and MDA specificities, the amounts of these Abs were substantially boosted by treatment of mice with apoptotic cells. Moreover, the relative amounts of PC and MDA Abs was affected by VH gene inheritance. Ab interactions with apoptotic cells also mediated the recruitment of C1q, which enhanced apoptotic cell phagocytosis by immature dendritic cells. Significantly, IgM Abs to both PC and MDA were primary factors in determining the efficiency of serum-dependent apoptotic cell phagocytosis.

Until recently, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended protecting young infants by “cocooning” or vaccination of postpartum mothers and other close contacts with tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis, adsorbed (Tdap) booster vaccine. ACIP recommends pregnancy vaccination as a preferred and safe alternative to postpartum vaccination. The ACIP cocooning recommendation has not changed. METHODS: We used a cohort model reflecting US 2009 births and the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis schedule to simulate a decision and cost-effectiveness analysis of Tdap vaccination during pregnancy compared with postpartum vaccination with or without vaccination of other close contacts (ie, cocooning). We analyzed infant pertussis cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, as well as direct disease, indirect, and public health costs for infants in the first year of life. All costs were updated to 2011 US dollars. RESULTS: Pregnancy vaccination could reduce annual infant pertussis incidence by more than postpartum vaccination, reducing cases by 33% versus 20%, hospitalizations by 38% versus 19%, and deaths by 49% versus 16%. Additional cocooning doses in a father and 1 grandparent could avert an additional 16% of cases but at higher cost. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year saved for pregnancy vaccination was substantially less than postpartum vaccination ($414 523 vs $1 172 825). CONCLUSIONS: Tdap vaccination during pregnancy could avert more infant cases and deaths at lower cost than postpartum vaccination, even when postpartum vaccination is combined with additional cocooning doses. Pregnancy dose vaccination is the preferred alternative to postpartum vaccination for preventing infant pertussis."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract The roots of most land plants are colonised by mycorrhizal fungi that provide mineral nutrients in exchange for carbon. Here, we show that mycorrhizal mycelia can also act as a conduit for signalling between plants, acting as an early warning system for herbivore attack. Insect herbivory causes systemic changes in the production of plant volatiles, particularly methyl salicylate, making bean plants, Vicia faba , repellent to aphids but attractive to aphid enemies such as parasitoids. We demonstrate that these effects can also occur in aphid‐free plants but only when they are connected to aphid‐infested plants via a common mycorrhizal mycelial network. This underground messaging system allows neighbouring plants to invoke herbivore defences before attack. Our findings demonstrate that common mycorrhizal mycelial networks can determine the outcome of multitrophic interactions by communicating information on herbivore attack between plants, thereby influencing the behaviour of both herbivores and their natural enemies."</span>

How histone variants such as H2AZ are incorporated into nucleosomes has been obscure. We have found that Swr1, a Swi2/Snf2-related adenosine triphosphatase, is the catalytic core of a multisubunit, histone-variant exchanger that efficiently replaces conventional histone H2A with histone H2AZ in nucleosome arrays. Swr1 is required for the deposition of histone H2AZ at specific chromosome locations in vivo, and Swr1 and H2AZ commonly regulate a subset of yeast genes.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cause neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), a disease characterized by the formation of cutaneous neurofibromas infiltrated with a high density of degranulating mast cells. A hallmark of cell lines generated from NF1 patients or Nf1-deficient mice is their propensity to hyperproliferate. Neurofibromin, the protein encoded by NF1, negatively regulates p21ras activity by accelerating the conversion of Ras-GTP to Ras-GDP. However, identification of alterations in specific p21ras effector pathways that control proliferation in NF1-deficient cells is incomplete and critical for understanding disease pathogenesis. Recent studies have suggested that the proliferative effects of p21ras may depend on signaling outputs from the small Rho GTPases, Rac and Rho, but the physiologic importance of these interactions in an animal disease model has not been established. Using a genetic intercross between Nf1+/− and Rac2−/− mice, we now provide genetic evidence to support a biochemical model where hyperactivation of the extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) via the hematopoietic-specific Rho GTPase, Rac2, directly contributes to the hyperproliferation of Nf1-deficient mast cells in vitro and in vivo. Further, we demonstrate that Rac2 functions as mediator of cross-talk between phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K) and the classical p21ras-Raf-Mek-ERK pathway to confer a distinct proliferative advantage to Nf1+/− mast cells. Thus, these studies identify Rac2 as a novel mediator of cross-talk between PI-3K and the p21ras-ERK pathway which functions to alter the cellular phenotype of a cell lineage involved in the pathologic complications of a common genetic disease."</span>

Although LXR activity has been proposed to be critical for physiologic lipid metabolism and transport, direct evidence linking LXR signaling pathways to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease has yet to be established. In this study bone marrow transplantations were used to selectively eliminate macrophage LXR expression in the context of murine models of atherosclerosis. Our results demonstrate that LXRs are endogenous inhibitors of atherogenesis.

It predicts exotic phenomena like quantum phase transitions and ground-state entanglement in ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes, where coupling strengths are comparable to or larger than subsystem energies. Demonstrating dynamics remains an outstanding challenge, the few experiments reaching these regimes being limited to spectroscopy. Here, we employ a circuit quantum electrodynamics chip with moderate coupling between a resonator and transmon qubit to realise accurate digital quantum simulation of deep-strong coupling dynamics. We advance the state of the art in solid-state digital quantum simulation by using up to 90 second-order Trotter steps and probing both subsystems in a combined Hilbert space dimension of ∼80, demonstrating characteristic Schrödinger-cat-like entanglement and large photon build-up. Our approach will enable exploration of extreme coupling regimes and quantum phase transitions, and demonstrates a clear first step towards larger complexities such as in the Dicke model."</span>

This involves both positive-acting and negative-acting E2F proteins, the latter group including the E2F6 protein, which has been shown to function as an Rb-independent repressor of E2F-target gene transcription. In an effort to better delineate the context of E2F6 function, including the mechanisms of E2F6 functional specificity, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to assess when and with what genes E2F6 associates during a cell cycle. We find that E2F6 associates specifically with the E2F target genes that are activated at G1/S; this interaction occurs during S phase of the cell cycle. In sharp contrast, E2F6 does not bind to E2F-regulated genes activated at G2/M. In the absence of E2F6, E2F4 can bind to the G1/S-regulated promoters and compensate for loss of E2F6 function. Indeed, inhibition of both E2F4 and E2F6 activity results in specific derepression of these genes during S phase. We conclude that E2F6 functions as a repressor of E2F-dependent transcription during S phase and given the specificity for the G1/S-regulated genes, we propose that E2F6 functions to distinguish G1/S and G2/M transcription during the cell cycle."</span>

We also report that SinR and SlrR constitute a double-negative feedback loop in which SinR represses the gene for SlrR ( slrR ), and, by binding to (titrating) SinR, SlrR prevents SinR from repressing slrR . Thus, SlrR indirectly derepresses its own gene, creating a self-reinforcing loop. Finally, we show that, once activated, the loop remains locked in a high SlrR state in which cell separation and motility genes are OFF for extended periods of time.

Method: All English language papers on the prevalence of autism were reviewed. Ten of the studies retrieved were not used in the final analysis because they did not meet full criteria for inclusion in the review. The remaining 20 studies, published between 1966 and 1997, were subdivided into US studies ( n = 2) and non‐US studies (n= 18), and the latter group was subdivided into four 8‐year periods. Results: The early studies yielded prevalence rates of under 0.5 in 1000 children, whereas the later ones showed a mean rate of about 1 in 1000. There was a marked difference in prevalence rates between those studies that included some children born before 1970 (low rates) and those that included only children born in 1970 and after (high rates). This is probably due to the lower rates obtained by use of criteria strictly based on Kanner's description of his syndrome. The US studies reported atypically low rates. There was a highly significant estimated increase with calendar year in the non‐US studies (3.8%, per year). Conclusion: It is concluded that autism is considerably more common than was previously believed. The possible reasons for the higher reported rates are discussed."</span>

Here we use a forward genetic screen for Caulobacter crescentus motility mutants to identify a conserved single-domain PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) protein (MopJ) with pleiotropic regulatory functions. MopJ promotes re-accumulation of the master cell cycle regulator CtrA after its proteolytic destruction is triggered by the DivJ kinase at the G1-S transition. MopJ and CtrA syntheses are coordinately induced in S-phase, followed by the sequestration of MopJ to cell poles in Caulobacter . Polarization requires Caulobacter DivJ and the PopZ polar organizer. MopJ interacts with DivJ and influences the localization and activity of downstream cell cycle effectors.

We have developed a new model to study the regulation of antibody gene rearrangement. In this model, we used gene targeting to replace the J kappa region with a functional V kappa-J kappa light chain gene. Two different strains of mice were created; one, V kappa 4R, has a V kappa 4-J kappa 4 rearrangement followed by a downstream J kappa 5 segment, while the other, V kappa 8R, has a V kappa 8-J kappa 5 light chain. Here, we analyze the influence of these functional light chains on light chain rearrangement. We show that some V kappa 4R and V kappa 8R B cells only have the V kappa R light chain rearrangement, whereas others undergo additional rearrangements. Additional rearrangement can occur not only at the other kappa allele or isotype (lambda), but also at the targeted locus in both V kappa 4R and V kappa 8R. Rearrangement to the downstream J kappa 5 segment is observed in V kappa 4R, as is deletion of the targeted locus in both V kappa 4R and V kappa 8R. The V kappa R models illustrate that a productively rearranged light chain can either terminate further rearrangement or allow further rearrangement. We attribute the latter to editing of autoantibodies and to corrections of dysfunctional receptors."</span>

In this study, we investigated the potency of a clinical-grade soluble form of lymphocyte activation gene-3 protein (IMP321), a physiological high-affinity MHC class II binder, at inducing in PBMCs an appropriate cytotoxic-type response in short-term ex vivo assays. We found that IMP321 binds to a minority (&amp;lt;10%) of MHC class II + cells in PBMCs, including all myeloid dendritic cells, and a small fraction of monocytes. Four hours after addition of IMP321 to PBMCs, these myeloid cells produce TNF-α and CCL4 as determined by intracellular staining. At 18 h, 1% of CD8+ T cells and 3.7% NK cells produce Tc1 cytokines such as IFN-γ and/or TNF-α (mean values from 60 blood donors). Similar induction was observed in metastatic cancer patient PBMCs, but the values were lower for the NK cell subset. Early APC activation by IMP321 is needed for this Tc1-type activation because pure sorted CD8+ T cells could not be activated by IMP321. Only Ag-experienced, fully differentiated granzyme+ CD8 T cells (effector and effector memory but not naive or central memory T cells) are induced by IMP321 to full Tc1 activation. In contrast to IMP321, TLR1-9 agonists induce IL-10 and are therefore unable to induce this Tc1 IFN-γ+ response. Thus, IMP321 has many properties that confirm its potential to be a new class of immunopotentiator in cancer patients."</span>

ED-A fibronectin exerts a permissive action for α-smooth muscle actin expression. A morphological continuity (called fibronexus), a specialized form of focal adhesion, has been described between actin stress fibers that contain α-smooth muscle actin, and extracellular fibronectin, which contains the ED-A portion, in both cultured fibroblasts and granulation tissue myofibroblasts. We have studied the development of these focal adhesions in TGFβ-treated fibroblasts using confocal laser scanning microscopy, three-dimensional image reconstruction and western blots using antibodies against focal adhesion proteins. The increase in ED-A fibronectin expression induced by TGFβ was accompanied by bundling of ED-A fibronectin fibers and their association with the terminal portion of α-smooth muscle actin-positive stress fibers. In parallel, the focal adhesion size was importantly increased, and tensin and FAK were neoexpressed in focal adhesions; moreover, vinculin and paxillin were recruited from the cytoplasmic pool into focal adhesions. We have evaluated morphometrically the length and area of focal adhesions. In addition, we have evaluated biochemically their content of associated proteins and of α-smooth muscle actin after TGFβ stimulation and on this basis suggest a new focal adhesion classification, that is, immature, mature and supermature. When TGFβ-induced α-smooth muscle actin expression was blocked by soluble recombinant ED-A fibronectin, we observed that the fragment was localised into the fibronectin network at the level of focal adhesions and that focal adhesion supermaturation was inhibited. The same effect was also exerted by the ED-A fibronectin antibody IST-9. In addition, the antagonists of actin-myosin contractility BDM and ML-7 provoked the dispersion of focal adhesions and the decrease of α-smooth muscle actin content in stress fibers of pulmonary fibroblasts, which constitutively show large focal adhesions and numerous stress fibers that contain α-smooth muscle actin. These inhibitors also decreased the incorporation of recombinant ED-A into fibronectin network. Our data indicate that a three-dimensional transcellular structure containing both ED-A fibronectin and α-smooth muscle actin plays an important role in the establishment and modulation of the myofibroblastic phenotype.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"ABSTRACT An abnormal microheterogeneous component of serum transferrin, with a higher isoelectric point than the normal main component, was studied by means of isoelectric focusing and direct immunofixation in 98 alcoholic patients, 22 patients with liver diseases and 100 controls. Its relation to acute and prolonged ethanol intake was studied in healthy volunteers. The abnormal transferrin component was found to be a sensitive indicator of prolonged, high alcohol ingestion, and was observed in 81% of patients with an admitted consumption of more than 60 g ethanol/day, and normalized after at least 10 days of abstinence. It occurred in 1% of the controls and in none of the cases with liver diseases without current alcohol abuse. There is evidence of a reduced sialic acid content in the abnormal transferrin. No similar change has been found in a number of other glycoproteins. This test may be a useful and sensitive tool for the detection of chronic alcohol consumption."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Riboswitches are commonly used by bacteria to detect a variety of metabolites and ions to regulate gene expression. To date, nearly 40 different classes of riboswitches have been discovered, experimentally validated, and modeled at atomic resolution in complex with their cognate ligands. The research findings produced since the first riboswitch validation reports in 2002 reveal that these noncoding RNA domains exploit many different structural features to create binding pockets that are extremely selective for their target ligands. Some riboswitch classes are very common and are present in bacteria from nearly all lineages, whereas others are exceedingly rare and appear in only a few species whose DNA has been sequenced. Presented herein are the consensus sequences, structural models, and phylogenetic distributions for all validated riboswitch classes. Based on our findings, we predict that there are potentially many thousands of distinct bacterial riboswitch classes remaining to be discovered, but that the rarity of individual undiscovered classes will make it increasingly difficult to find additional examples of this RNA-based sensory and gene control mechanism."</span>

CSCs are hypothesized to be a small population of cells within a tumor that are endowed with the unique capacity to drive tumor growth—a scenario that in principle would offer important therapeutic opportunities. By studying mice expressing multicolor reporter genes, Schepers et al. (p. 730 , published online 1 August) were able to visualize and monitor the fate of a candidate stem cell for intestinal adenomas, an early stage of cancer. This “lineage tracing” analysis suggests that tumor cells expressing the intestinal crypt stem cell marker Lgr5 (leucine-rich repeat containing G protein–coupled receptor 5) are the cells that fuel the growth of intestinal adenomas."</span>

We have previously shown that the human decapping factors hDcp2 and hDcp1a are concentrated in specific cytoplasmic structures. Here, we show that hCcr4, hDcp1b, hLsm, and rck/p54 proteins related to 5′–3′ mRNA decay also localize to these structures, whereas DcpS, which is involved in cap nucleotide catabolism, is nuclear. Functional analysis using fluorescence resonance energy transfer revealed that hDcp1a and hDcp2 interact in vivo in these structures that were shown to differ from the previously described stress granules. Our data indicate that these new structures are dynamic, as they disappear when mRNA breakdown is abolished by treatment with inhibitors. Accumulation of poly(A)+ RNA in these structures, after RNAi-mediated inactivation of the Xrn1 exonuclease, demonstrates that they represent active mRNA decay sites.

In a screen for miRNAs regulated by myocardin-related transcription factor-A (MRTF-A), a coactivator of serum response factor (SRF), we discovered a muscle-enriched miRNA, miR-486, controlled by an alternative promoter within intron 40 of the Ankyrin-1 gene. Transcription of miR-486 is directly controlled by SRF and MRTF-A, as well as by MyoD. Among the most strongly predicted targets of miR-486 are phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and Foxo1a, which negatively affect phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling. Accordingly, PTEN and Foxo1a protein levels are reduced by miR-486 overexpression, which, in turn, enhances PI3K/Akt signaling. Similarly, we show that MRTF-A promotes PI3K/Akt signaling by up-regulating miR-486 expression. Conversely, inhibition of miR-486 expression enhances the expression of PTEN and Foxo1a and dampens signaling through the PI3K/Akt-signaling pathway.

The goal of this principle is to exploit mechanical strain to tune the electronic and photonic performance of 2D materials and to ultimately achieve high‐performance 2D‐material‐based devices. Although strain engineering has been well studied for traditional semiconductor materials and is now routinely used in their manufacturing, recent experiments on strain engineering of 2D materials have shown new opportunities for fundamental physics and exciting applications, along with new challenges, due to the atomic nature of 2D materials. Here, recent advances in the application of mechanical strain into 2D materials are reviewed. These developments are categorized by the deformation modes of the 2D material–substrate system: in‐plane mode and out‐of‐plane mode. Recent state‐of‐the‐art characterization of the interface mechanics for these 2D material–substrate systems is also summarized. These advances highlight how the strain or strain‐coupled applications of 2D materials rely on the interfacial properties, essentially shear and adhesion, and finally offer direct guidelines for deterministic design of mechanical strains into 2D materials for ultrathin semiconductor applications."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Cellular senescence is a natural barrier to tumorigenesis and it contributes to the antitumor effects of several therapies, including radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs. Senescence also plays an important role in aging, fibrosis, and tissue repair. The DNA damage response is a key event leading to senescence, which is characterized by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that includes expression of inflammatory cytokines. Here we show that cGMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), a cytosolic DNA sensor that activates innate immunity, is essential for senescence. Deletion of cGAS accelerated the spontaneous immortalization of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. cGAS deletion also abrogated SASP induced by spontaneous immortalization or DNA damaging agents, including radiation and etoposide. cGAS is localized in the cytoplasm of nondividing cells but enters the nucleus and associates with chromatin DNA during mitosis in proliferating cells. DNA damage leads to accumulation of damaged DNA in cytoplasmic foci that contain cGAS. In human lung adenocarcinoma patients, low expression of cGAS is correlated with poor survival. These results indicate that cGAS mediates cellular senescence and retards immortalization. This is distinct from, and complementary to, the role of cGAS in activating antitumor immunity."</span>

This systematic review and meta‐analysis was conducted to provide an accurate prevalence estimate for this disorder using primary publications in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library. Data were pooled using Bayesian fixed‐effects and random‐effects models. Primary analyses assessed the frequency of the full mutation and premutation in males and females in the total population (no bias against individuals with intellectual disability) and in female carriers of the premutation in normal populations (biased against individuals with intellectual disability), based on diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction or Southern blotting. A sensitivity analysis included studies using any diagnostic testing method and conference abstracts. Sixty‐eight recorded observations provided data for the primary (56 observations) and sensitivity (12 observations) analysis. Using the random‐effects model, frequency of the full mutation was 1.4 (95% CI: 0.1–3.1) per 10,000 males and 0.9 (95% CI: 0.0–2.9) per 10,000 females (1:7,143 and 1:11,111, respectively) in the total population. The premutation frequency was 11.7 (95% CI: 6.0–18.7) per 10,000 males and 34.4 (95% CI: 6.3–83.3) per 10,000 for females (1:855 and 1:291, respectively) in the total population. The prevalence of female carriers of the premutation in the normal population was 34.4 (95% CI: 8.9–60.3) per 10,000, or 1:291.

Electron-dense plaques along the basal surface plasma membrane, termed hemidesmosomes, appear to attach directly to the lamina densa of the basement membrane through fine strands, called anchoring filaments. The lamina densa is secured to the stroma through a complex of type VII collagen containing anchoring fibrils and anchoring plaques. We have identified what we believe is a novel antigen unique to this tissue region. The mAbs to this antigen localize to the anchoring filaments, just below the basal-dense plate of the hemidesmosomes. In cell culture, the antigen is deposited upon the culture substate by growing and migrating human keratinocytes. Addition of mAb to the cultures causes the cells to round and detach, but does not impair them metabolically. Skin fragments incubated with antibody extensively de-epithelialize. These findings strongly suggest that this antigen is intimately involved in attachment of keratinocytes to the basement membrane. This antigen was isolated from keratinocyte cultures by immunoaffinity chromatography. Two molecules are observed. The most intact species contains three nonidentical chains, 165, 155, and 140 kD linked by interchain disulfide bonds. The second and more abundant species contains the 165- and 140-kD chains, but the 155-kD chain has been proteolytically cleaved to 105 kD. Likewise, two rotary-shadowed images are observed. The larger of the two, presumably corresponding to the most intact form, appears as an asymmetric 107-nm-long rod, with a single globule at one end and two smaller globules at the other.

Here we characterize these lymphoid and nonlymphoid components in terms of chemokine signals. The lymphoid population expresses CXCR5 and has a strong chemotactic response to B lymphocyte chemoattractant (BLC). Importantly, chemokines produced by VCAM-1+ICAM-1+ nonlymphoid cells mediate the recruitment of lymphoid cells. Furthermore, we show that these VCAM-1+ICAM-1+ cells are mesenchymal cells that are activated by lymphoid cells through the LTβR to express adhesion molecules and chemokines.

Because this reduction in background synaptic activity could modify the integrative properties of cortical neurons, we compared the impact of spontaneous synaptic events on the resting properties of intracellularly recorded pyramidal neurons in vivo and in vitro by blocking synaptic transmission with tetrodotoxin (TTX). The amount of synaptic activity was much lower in brain slices (at 34°C), as the standard deviation of the intracellular signal was 10–17 times lower in vitro than in vivo. Input resistances ( R in s) measured in vivo during relatively quiescent epochs (“control R in s”) could be reduced by up to 70% during periods of intense spontaneous activity. Further, the control R in s were increased by ∼30–70% after TTX application in vivo, approaching in vitro values. In contrast, TTX produced negligible R in changes in vitro (∼4%). These results indicate that, compared with the in vitro situation, the background synaptic activity present in intact networks dramatically reduces the electrical compactness of cortical neurons and modifies their integrative properties. The impact of the spontaneous synaptic bombardment should be taken into account when extrapolating in vitro findings to the intact brain."</span>

This study investigates the influence of antigen kinetics on CD8 T cell responses in mice. A fixed cumulative antigen dose was administered by different schedules to produce distinct dose-kinetics. Antigenic stimulation increasing exponentially over days was a stronger stimulus for CD8 T cells and antiviral immunity than a single dose or multiple dosing with daily equal doses. The same was observed for dendritic cell vaccination, with regard to T cell and anti-tumor responses, and for T cells stimulated in vitro . In conclusion, stimulation kinetics per se was shown to be a separate parameter of immunogenicity. These findings warrant a revision of current immunization models and have implications for vaccine development and immunotherapy."</span>

CD16+ monocytes produce high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and may represent dendritic cell precursors in vivo. The mechanisms that mediate the recruitment of CD16+ monocytes into tissues remain unknown. Here we investigate molecular mechanisms of CD16+ monocyte trafficking and show that migration of CD16+ and CD16− monocytes is mediated by distinct combinations of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors. In contrast to CD16− monocytes, CD16+ monocytes expressed high CX3CR1 and CXCR4 but low CCR2 and CD62L levels and underwent efficient transendo-thelial migration in response to fractalkine (FKN; FKN/CX3CL1) and stromal-derived factor 1α (CXCL12) but not monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (CCL2). CD16+ monocytes arrested on cell surface–expressed FKN under flow with higher frequency compared with CD16− monocytes.

To better understand how this is accomplished anatomically, we asked whether parallel pathways originating in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and terminating separately in layer IV, remain separate in layer III of macaque monkeys. Layer III is of interest since it may play a special role in color and form vision but not in analysis of visual motion. The chief finding was that cells in "blobs" of layer III that stain densely for cytochrome oxidase receive indirect input, via layer IVC, from both LGN magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) cells. This is important because the P and M pathways may represent color/form and motion-processing channels, respectively. Interblob cells receive indirect input, via layers IVC and IVA, from the LGN P cells. Also, as suggested by others, our data demonstrate that layer III can be subdivided. The bottom tier, layer IIIB, receives direct projections from all cortical layers. Output from layer IIIB appears to remain intrinsic to striate cortex. In contrast, the top tier, layer IIIA, receives projections from layer IIIB as well as from layers IVA, IVB (blobs only), and V, but it receives no direct projections from LGN recipient layers IVC and VI. Unlike layer IIIB, the output of layer IIIA reaches extrastriate areas. Thus, impulses arriving from parallel LGN pathways may be recombined through serial stages in striate cortex to produce a set of parallel pathways that are qualitatively different from the original LGN set."</span>

We have developed a method based on random genome fragments and DNA microarray technology that overcomes the disadvantages of whole-genome DNA-DNA hybridization. Reference genomes of four fluorescent Pseudomonas species were fragmented, and 60 to 96 genome fragments of approximately 1 kb from each strain were spotted on microarrays. Genomes from 12 well-characterized fluorescent Pseudomonas strains were labeled with Cy dyes and hybridized to the arrays. Cluster analysis of the hybridization profiles revealed taxonomic relationships between bacterial strains tested at species to strain level resolution, suggesting that this approach is useful for the identification of bacteria as well as determining the genetic distance among bacteria. Since arrays can contain thousands of DNA spots, a single array has the potential for broad identification capacity. In addition, the method does not require laborious cross-hybridizations and can provide an open database of hybridization profiles, avoiding the limitations of traditional DNA-DNA hybridization."</span>

The attaching and effacing lesion is encoded by the Locus of Enterocyte Effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island, which encodes a type III secretion system, the intimin intestinal colonization factor, and the translocated intimin receptor protein that is translocated from the bacterium to the host epithelial cells. Using lacZ reporter gene fusions, we show that expression of the LEE operons encoding the type III secretion system, translocated intimin receptor, and intimin is regulated by quorum sensing in both enterohemorrhagic E. coli and enteropathogenic E. coli . The luxS gene recently shown to be responsible for production of autoinducer in the Vibrio harveyi and E. coli quorum-sensing systems is responsible for regulation of the LEE operons, as shown by the mutation and complementation of the luxS gene. Regulation of intestinal colonization factors by quorum sensing could play an important role in the pathogenesis of disease caused by these organisms. These results suggest that intestinal colonization by E. coli O157:H7, which has an unusually low infectious dose, could be induced by quorum sensing of signals produced by nonpathogenic E. coli of the normal intestinal flora."</span>

Participants first learned to recognize six individuals on the basis of a simple, unexaggerated arm movement. Subsequently, they recognized positively exaggerated versions of those movements better than the originals. Absolute duration did not appear to be the critical cue. The results show that time-based cues are used for the recognition of movements and that exaggerating temporal differences improves performance.

In mammals, there are two other members of the polo-like kinase family that are less well understood, Plk2 and Plk3. Plk3 first was identified and cloned as an immediate early gene. Here, we report Plk3 localizes to the nucleolus and is involved in regulation of the G 1 /S phase transition. We demonstrate that the level of Plk3 protein is cell cycle regulated, peaking in G 1 . We have delivered Plk3-interfering RNA with lentivirus to serum-starved cells and found that, upon serum stimulation, Plk3 is required for cyclin E expression and entry into S phase. Plk3-interfering RNA-induced Plk3 depletion resulted in a large fraction of asynchronously proliferating cells to become quiescent. We propose the Plk3 requirement in the cell cycle is fulfilled in G 1 , and that once cells pass this point, they are able to complete cell division, whereas in the absence of Plk3, they fail to reenter the cell cycle. Additional data suggest that Plk3 may regulate entry into S phase in part through interaction with the phosphatase Cdc25A, because its depletion also resulted in attenuation of cyclin E expression."</span>

When close or looming, such threats engage evolutionarily conserved monitoring systems and defense reactions that promote self-preservation.

Activity in the amygdala was also associated with underprediction of the tarantula's threat value and, in addition to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, with monitoring the tarantula's threat value as indexed by its direction of movement. Conversely, the orbitofrontal cortex was engaged as the tarantula grew more distant, suggesting that this region emits safety signals or expels fear.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Tau protein accumulation is the most common pathology among degenerative brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and over twenty others. Tau‐containing neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) accumulation is the closest correlate with cognitive decline and cell loss (Arriagada, Growdon, Hedley‐Whyte, &amp; Hyman, ), yet mechanisms mediating tau toxicity are poorly understood. NFT formation does not induce apoptosis (de Calignon, Spires‐Jones, Pitstick, Carlson, &amp; Hyman, 2009), which suggests that secondary mechanisms are driving toxicity. Transcriptomic analyses of NFT‐containing neurons microdissected from postmortem AD brain revealed an expression profile consistent with cellular senescence. This complex stress response induces aberrant cell cycle activity, adaptations to maintain survival, cellular remodeling, and metabolic dysfunction. Using four AD transgenic mouse models, we found that NFTs, but not Aβ plaques, display a senescence‐like phenotype. Cdkn2a transcript level, a hallmark measure of senescence, directly correlated with brain atrophy and NFT burden in mice. This relationship extended to postmortem brain tissue from humans with PSP to indicate a phenomenon common to tau toxicity. Tau transgenic mice with late‐stage pathology were treated with senolytics to remove senescent cells. Despite the advanced age and disease progression, MRI brain imaging and histopathological analyses indicated a reduction in total NFT density, neuron loss, and ventricular enlargement. Collectively, these findings indicate a strong association between the presence of NFTs and cellular senescence in the brain, which contributes to neurodegeneration. Given the prevalence of tau protein deposition among neurodegenerative diseases, these findings have broad implications for understanding, and potentially treating, dozens of brain diseases."</span>

Expression of tachykinin precursor 1 and NK‐1R was significantly higher in liver samples from primary sclerosing cholangitis patients compared to healthy controls. Knockout of NK‐1R decreased BDL‐induced liver fibrosis, and treatment with L‐733,060 resulted in decreased liver fibrosis in Mdr2 –/– mice, which was shown by decreased sirius red staining, fibrosis gene and protein expression, and reduced transforming growth factor‐β1 levels in serum and cholangiocyte supernatants.

Symmetric RFBs based on MB electrolyte demonstrate remarkable stability with no capacity decay over 1200 cycles. Even concentrated MB catholyte (1.5 m ) is still able to deliver stable capacity over hundreds of cycles in a full cell system.

Here we show that NRG1, via stimulating GABA release from interneurons, inhibits pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Ablation of the NRG1 receptor ErbB4 in parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons prevented NRG1 from stimulating GABA release and from inhibiting pyramidal neurons. PV-ErbB4 −/− mice exhibited schizophrenia-relevant phenotypes similar to those observed in NRG1 or ErbB4 null mutant mice, including hyperactivity, impaired working memory, and deficit in prepulse inhibition (PPI) that was ameliorated by diazepam, a GABA enhancer. These results indicate that NRG1 regulates the activity of pyramidal neurons by promoting GABA release from PV-positive interneurons, identifying a critical function of NRG1 in balancing brain activity.

In this study, we identify a particular set of iNKT cells that lack the NK1.1 marker (NK1.1neg) and secrete high amounts of interleukin (IL)-17 and low levels of interferon (IFN)-γ and IL-4. NK1.1neg iNKT cells produce IL-17 upon synthetic (α-galactosylceramide [α-GalCer] or PBS-57), as well as natural (lipopolysaccharides or glycolipids derived from Sphingomonas wittichii and Borrelia burgdorferi), ligand stimulation. NK1.1neg iNKT cells are more frequent in the lung, which is consistent with a role in the natural immunity to inhaled antigens. Indeed, airway neutrophilia induced by α-GalCer or lipopolysaccharide instillation was significantly reduced in iNKT-cell–deficient Jα18−/− mice, which produced significantly less IL-17 in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid than wild-type controls. Furthermore, airway neutrophilia was abolished by a single treatment with neutralizing monoclonal antibody against IL-17 before α-GalCer administration. Collectively, our findings reveal that NK1.1neg iNKT lymphocytes represent a new population of IL-17–producing cells that can contribute to neutrophil recruitment through preferential IL-17 secretion."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Infection of C57BL/6 mice with most Leishmania major strains results in a healing lesion and clearance of parasites from the skin. Infection of C57BL/6 mice with the L. major Seidman strain ( Lm Sd), isolated from a patient with chronic lesions, despite eliciting a strong Th1 response, results in a nonhealing lesion, poor parasite clearance, and complete destruction of the ear dermis. We show here that in comparison to a healing strain, Lm Sd elicited early upregulation of IL‐1β mRNA and IL‐1β‐producing dermal cells and prominent neutrophil recruitment to the infected skin. Mice deficient in Nlrp3, apoptosis‐associated speck‐like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain, or caspase‐1/11, or lacking IL‐1β or IL‐1 receptor signaling, developed healing lesions and cleared Lm Sd from the infection site. Mice resistant to Lm Sd had a stronger antigen‐specific Th1 response. The possibility that IL‐1β might act through neutrophil recruitment to locally suppress immunity was supported by the healing observed in neutropenic Genista mice. Secretion of mature IL‐1β by Lm Sd‐infected macrophages in vitro was dependent on activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome and caspase‐1. These data reveal that Nlrp3 inflammasome‐dependent IL‐1β, associated with localized neutrophil recruitment, plays a crucial role in the development of a nonhealing form of cutaneous leishmaniasis in conventionally resistant mice."</span>

In yeast, Rad53 kinase protects stalled replication forks from pathological rearrangements. To characterize the mechanisms controlling fork integrity, we analyzed replication intermediates formed in response to replication blocks using electron microscopy. At the forks, wild-type cells accumulate short single-stranded regions, which likely causes checkpoint activation, whereas rad53 mutants exhibit extensive single-stranded gaps and hemi-replicated intermediates, consistent with a lagging-strand synthesis defect. Further, rad53 cells accumulate Holliday junctions through fork reversal.

The cysteine-captured ligands, which are readily identified by MS, are among the most stable complexes, even though in the absence of the covalent tether the ligands may bind very weakly.

The cagA -encoded CagA protein is delivered into gastric epithelial cells via the bacterial type IV secretion system and, upon tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases, specifically binds to and aberrantly activates SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase, a bona fide oncoprotein in human malignancies. CagA also elicits junctional and polarity defects in epithelial cells by interacting with and inhibiting partitioning-defective 1 (PAR1)/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK) independently of CagA tyrosine phosphorylation. Despite these CagA activities that contribute to neoplastic transformation, a causal link between CagA and in vivo oncogenesis remains unknown. Here, we generated transgenic mice expressing wild-type or phosphorylation-resistant CagA throughout the body or predominantly in the stomach. Wild-type CagA transgenic mice showed gastric epithelial hyperplasia and some of the mice developed gastric polyps and adenocarcinomas of the stomach and small intestine. Systemic expression of wild-type CagA further induced leukocytosis with IL-3/GM-CSF hypersensitivity and some mice developed myeloid leukemias and B cell lymphomas, the hematological malignancies also caused by gain-of-function SHP-2 mutations. Such pathological abnormalities were not observed in transgenic mice expressing phosphorylation-resistant CagA. These results provide first direct evidence for the role of CagA as a bacterium-derived oncoprotein (bacterial oncoprotein) that acts in mammals and further indicate the importance of CagA tyrosine phosphorylation, which enables CagA to deregulate SHP-2, in the development of H. pylori -associated neoplasms."</span>

OS patients carry leaky mutations of recombination activating genes (RAG1 or RAG2) resulting in partial V(D)J recombination activity, whereas null mutations cause severe combined immunodeficiency with absence of mature T and B cells (T-B- SCID).

However, a cause-and-effect relationship between LB/LN formation and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Indeed, whether LB/LNs are toxic or represent a neuroprotective response has been contentious. Luk et al.

Furthermore, the formation of LB/LNs and their accumulation in SNpc resulted in the progressive loss of these dopaminergic neurons, reduced dopamine innervations to the dorsal striatum, and culminated in motor deficits similar to PD.

Phosphoinositide signaling is believed to play an important role in cytoskeletal organization, but it is unclear whether lipids, which can diffuse along the membrane, can mediate the focal actin assembly required for phagocytosis. We used imaging of fluorescent chimeras of pleckstrin homology and C1 domains in live macrophages to monitor the distribution of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (4,5-PIP2) and diacylglycerol, respectively, during phagocytosis. Our results reveal a sequence of exquisitely localized, coordinated steps in phospholipid metabolism: a focal, rapid accumulation of 4,5-PIP2 accompanied by recruitment of type Iα phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase to the phagosomal cup, followed by disappearance of the phosphoinositide as the phagosome seals. Loss of 4,5-PIP2 correlated with mobilization of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and with the localized formation of diacylglycerol. The presence of 4,5-PIP2 and active PLCγ at the phagosome was shown to be essential for effective particle ingestion. The temporal sequence of phosphoinositide metabolism suggests that accumulation of 4,5-PIP2 is involved in the initial recruitment of actin to the phagocytic cup, while its degradation contributes to the subsequent cytoskeletal remodeling."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Fear can be extinguished by repeated exposure to a cue that signals threat. However, extinction does not erase fear, as an extinguished cue presented in a context distinct from that of extinction results in renewed fear of that cue. The hippocampus, which is involved in the formation of contextual representations, is a natural candidate structure for investigations into the neural circuitry underlying fear renewal. Thus far, studies examining the necessity of the hippocampus for fear renewal have produced mixed results. We isolated the conditions under which the hippocampus may be required for renewal. Rats received lesions of the dorsal hippocampus either prior to tone fear conditioning or following extinction. Fear renewal was measured using discrete tone presentations or a long, continuous tone. The topography of fear responding at test was assessed by comparing “early” and “sustained” renewal, where early fear was determined by freezing to the first discrete tone or the equivalent initial segment of a continuous tone and sustained fear was determined by freezing averaged across all discrete tones or the entire continuous tone. We found that following pretraining damage of the hippocampus, early renewal remained intact regardless of lesion condition. However, sustained renewal only persisted in discrete, but not continuous, tone‐tested animals. A more extensive analysis of the topography of fear responding revealed that the disruption of renewal was generated when the tone duration at test began to violate that used during extinction, suggesting that the hippocampus is sensitive to mismatches in CS‐duration. Postextinction lesions resulted in an overall reduction of fear renewal. This pattern of results is consistent with those observed for contextual fear conditioning, wherein animals display a resistance to anterograde amnesia despite the presence of a strong retrograde amnesia for the same contextual information. Furthermore, the data support a role for the hippocampus in sustaining renewal when the CS duration at test does not match that used during extinction. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Exogenous application of agonists at the kainate subtype of glutamate receptors has been shown to depress evoked monosynaptic inhibition by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons in the hippocampus. This observation has led to the hypothesis that synaptic release of endogenous glutamate might have a disinhibitory effect on neuronal circuits, in addition to depolarizing neurons via postsynaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), kainate, and N -methyl- d -aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. It is not known, however, if glutamate released from excitatory neurons has the same kainate receptor-mediated effect on monosynaptic inhibitory transmission as exogenous agonist application. Indeed, the recent demonstration that excitatory synaptic signals elicited in interneurons are partly mediated by kainate receptors suggests that these receptors may have a pro- rather than disinhibitory role. Here, we examine the effect of synaptically released glutamate on monosynaptic inhibitory signaling. In the presence of antagonists to AMPA and NMDA receptors, brief bursts of activity in glutamatergic afferent fibers reduce GABAergic transmission. This depression of inhibition is reversibly abolished by blocking kainate receptors. It persists when GABA B receptors are blocked and is enhanced by blocking metabotropic glutamate receptors, possibly explained by presynaptic regulation of glutamate release from excitatory afferents by metabotropic autoreceptors. We conclude that the net kainate receptor-mediated effect of synaptically released glutamate is to reduce monosynaptic inhibition. Since this form of disinhibition may contribute to seizure initiation, kainate receptors may constitute an important target for anticonvulsant drug development."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The role of the brain in chronic pain conditions remains speculative. We compared brain morphology of 26 chronic back pain (CBP) patients to matched control subjects, using magnetic resonance imaging brain scan data and automated analysis techniques. CBP patients were divided into neuropathic, exhibiting pain because of sciatic nerve damage, and non-neuropathic groups. Pain-related characteristics were correlated to morphometric measures. Neocortical gray matter volume was compared after skull normalization. Patients with CBP showed 5-11% less neocortical gray matter volume than control subjects. The magnitude of this decrease is equivalent to the gray matter volume lost in 10-20 years of normal aging. The decreased volume was related to pain duration, indicating a 1.3 cm 3 loss of gray matter for every year of chronic pain. Regional gray matter density in 17 CBP patients was compared with matched controls using voxel-based morphometry and nonparametric statistics. Gray matter density was reduced in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right thalamus and was strongly related to pain characteristics in a pattern distinct for neuropathic and non-neuropathic CBP. Our results imply that CBP is accompanied by brain atrophy and suggest that the pathophysiology of chronic pain includes thalamocortical processes."</span>

To determine tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic determinants of response, we studied 44 adults with relapsed or refractory B-ALL (including 2 minimal residual disease positive) treated with blinatumomab using bulk tumor and single-cell sequencing. The overall response rate in patients with hematological disease was 55%, with a high response rate in those with CRLF2-rearranged Philadelphia chromosome–like ALL (12 [75%] of 16). Pretreatment samples of responders exhibited a tumor-intrinsic transcriptomic signature of heightened immune response. Multiple mechanisms resulted in loss of CD19 expression, including CD19 mutations, CD19-mutant allele-specific expression, low CD19 RNA expression, and mutations in CD19 signaling complex member CD81. Patients with low hypodiploid ALL were prone to CD19− relapse resulting from aneuploidy-mediated loss of the nonmutated CD19 allele. Increased expression of a CD19 isoform with intraexonic splicing of exon 2, CD19 ex2part, at baseline or during therapy was associated with treatment failure. These analyses demonstrate both tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors influence blinatumomab response. We show that CD19 mutations are commonly detected in CD19− relapse during blinatumomab treatment. Identification of the CD19 ex2part splice variant represents a new biomarker predictive of blinatumomab therapy failure."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"ABSTRACT Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs) present an incomplete barrier to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) neuroinvasion. In order to clarify the mechanisms of HIV-1 invasion, we have examined HIV-1 uptake and transcellular penetration in an in vitro BMVEC model. No evidence of productive infection was observed by luciferase, PCR, and reverse transcriptase assays. Approximately 1% of viral RNA and 1% of infectious virus penetrated the BMVEC barrier without disruption of tight junctions. The virus upregulated ICAM-1 on plasma membranes and in cytoplasmic vesiculotubular structures. HIV-1 virions were entangled by microvilli and were taken into cytoplasmic vesicles through surface invaginations without fusion of the virus envelope with the plasma membrane. Subsequently, the cytoplasmic vesicles fused with lysosomes, the virions were lysed, and the vesicles diminished in size. Upon cell entry, HIV-1 colocalized with cholera toxin B, which targets lipid raft-associated GM1 ganglioside. Cholesterol-extracting agents, cyclodextrin and nystatin, and polyanion heparin significantly inhibited virus entry. Anti-CD4 had no effect and the chemokine AOP-RANTES had only a slight inhibitory effect on virus entry. HIV-1 activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and inhibition of MAPK/Erk kinase inhibited virus entry. Entry was also blocked by dimethylamiloride, indicating that HIV-1 enters endothelial cells by macropinocytosis. Therefore, HIV-1 penetrates BMVECs in ICAM-1-lined macropinosomes by a mechanism involving lipid rafts, MAPK signaling, and glycosylaminoglycans, while CD4 and chemokine receptors play limited roles in this process."</span>

Previous work showed that this complex binds to the sides of actin filaments and is concentrated at the leading edges of motile cells. Here, we show that Arp2/3 complex purified from Acanthamoeba caps the pointed ends of actin filaments with high affinity. Arp2/3 complex inhibits both monomer addition and dissociation at the pointed ends of actin filaments with apparent nanomolar affinity and increases the critical concentration for polymerization at the pointed end from 0.6 to 1.0 μM. The high affinity of Arp2/3 complex for pointed ends and its abundance in amoebae suggest that in vivo all actin filament pointed ends are capped by Arp2/3 complex. Arp2/3 complex also nucleates formation of actin filaments that elongate only from their barbed ends. From kinetic analysis, the nucleation mechanism appears to involve stabilization of polymerization intermediates (probably actin dimers). In electron micrographs of quick-frozen, deep-etched samples, we see Arp2/3 bound to sides and pointed ends of actin filaments and examples of Arp2/3 complex attaching pointed ends of filaments to sides of other filaments. In these cases, the angle of attachment is a remarkably constant 70 ± 7°. From these in vitro biochemical properties, we propose a model for how Arp2/3 complex controls the assembly of a branching network of actin filaments at the leading edge of motile cells."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The role of rare alleles in complex phenotypes has been hotly debated, but most rare variant association tests (RVATs) do not account for the evolutionary forces that affect genetic architecture. Here, we use simulation and numerical algorithms to show that explosive population growth, as experienced by human populations, can dramatically increase the impact of very rare alleles on trait variance. We then assess the ability of RVATs to detect causal loci using simulations and human RNA-seq data. Surprisingly, we find that statistical performance is worst for phenotypes in which genetic variance is due mainly to rare alleles, and explosive population growth decreases power. Although many studies have attempted to identify causal rare variants, few have reported novel associations. This has sometimes been interpreted to mean that rare variants make negligible contributions to complex trait heritability. Our work shows that RVATs are not robust to realistic human evolutionary forces, so general conclusions about the impact of rare variants on complex traits may be premature."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"✓ Malignant gliomas have been difficult to treat with chemotherapy. The most effective agent, BCNU (carmustine), has considerable systemic toxicity and a short half-life in serum. To obviate these problems, a method has been developed for the local sustained release of chemotherapeutic agents by their incorporation into biodegradable polymers. Implantation of the drug-impregnated polymer at the tumor site allows prolonged local exposure with minimal systemic exposure. In this Phase I–II study, 21 patients with recurrent malignant glioma were treated with BCNU released interstitially by means of a polyanhydride biodegradable polymer implant. Up to eight polymer wafers were placed in the resection cavity intraoperatively, upon completion of tumor debulking. The polymer releases the therapeutic drug for approximately 3 weeks. Three increasing concentrations of BCNU were studied; the treatment was well tolerated at all three levels. There were no adverse reactions to the BCNU wafer treatment itself The average survival period after reoperation was 65 weeks for the first dose group, 64 weeks for the second dose group, and 32 weeks for the highest dose group. The overall mean survival time was 48 weeks from reoperation and 94 weeks from the original operation. The overall median survival times were 46 weeks postimplant and 87 weeks from initial surgery. Eighteen (86%) of 21 patients lived more than 1 year from the time of their initial diagnosis and eight (38%) of 21 patients lived more than 1 year after intracranial implantation of the polymer. Frequent hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis tests did not reveal any systemic effect from this interstitial chemotherapy. Since the therapy is well tolerated and safe, a placebo-controlled clinical trial has been started. The trial will measure the effect of the second treatment dose on survival of patients with recurrent malignant glioma."</span>

This two‐step procedure drastically reduces computational time and memory requirements compared with other programs. DROMPA enables the identification of protein localization sites in repetitive sequences and efficiently identifies both broad and sharp protein localization peaks.

Ordinarily expressed only transiently in the G2/M stage of the cell cycle in normal cells, cyclin B1 is constitutively expressed at high levels in the cytoplasm of these and many other tumor types, leading to its recognition by the cancer patient's immune system. We report here an unexpected observation that cyclin B1-specific antibody and memory CD4 and CD8 T cells are also found in many healthy individuals who have no history of cancer. Moreover, young as well as older healthy people have these responses suggesting that events other than cancer, which occur either early in life or throughout life, may lead to aberrant cyclin B1 expression and anti-cyclin B1 immunity. The role, if any, of immunity to this tumor-associated antigen is not known. We wanted to determine specifically whether immunity to cyclin B1 might be important in the immunosurveillance of cyclin B1+ tumors. We therefore tested in mice the effectiveness of vaccine-elicited anti-cyclin B1 immunity against a cyclin B1+ mouse tumor that was chosen based on our published observation that cyclin B1 overexpression is associated with the lack of p53 function.

The demand for next‐generation displays has driven the development of the optoelectronic materials with narrow linewidth. Until now, most optoelectronic materials usually give emission with full width at half maximum exceeding 30 nm. The lack of a general approach to further improving the color purity has limited their applications for next‐generation displays. Here, a universal resonance‐enhanced photon recycling strategy is developed to realize current‐driven displays with unprecedented high color rendering based on the perovskite light‐emitting diode (LED) arrays in distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) cavity. Benefiting from the outstanding optoelectronic properties and solution processability, perovskites are processed into micro‐LED arrays through a screen‐printing technology. The light output from individual micro‐LED is strongly modulated by resonance‐enhanced photon recycling derived from the cavity structure, leading to significant spectral narrowing and directional emission. On this basis, unprecedented high‐color‐purity is achieved in a prototype of current‐driven display panels. The outstanding performance of red, green, and blue (RGB) micro‐LED arrays with resonance‐enhanced photon recycling provides a deep insight into the design concepts and device structures for next‐generation display technology."</span>

In absence of geographical barriers to dispersal, this adaptive divergence (AD) may be constrained by gene flow (GF). And yet the reverse may also be true, with AD constraining GF (i.e. ‘ecological speciation’). Both of these causal effects have frequently been inferred from the presence of negative correlations between AD and GF in nature – yet the bi‐directional causality warrants caution in such inferences. We discuss how the ability of correlative studies to infer causation might be improved through the simultaneous measurement of multiple ecological and evolutionary variables. On the one hand, inferences about the causal role of GF can be made by examining correlations between AD and the potential for dispersal. On the other hand, inferences about the causal role of AD can be made by examining correlations between GF and environmental differences. Experimental manipulations of dispersal and environmental differences are a particularly promising approach for inferring causation. At present, the best studies find strong evidence that GF constrains AD and some studies also find the reverse. Improvements in empirical approaches promise to eventually allow general inferences about the relative strength of different causal interactions during adaptive diversification."</span>

Many, but not all, strains produce prodigiosin, a secondary metabolic, red-pigment antibiotic, the biosynthesis of which is directed by the pig gene cluster. Quorum sensing (QS) involves the production and detection of chemical signal molecules as a means to regulate gene expression in response to population cell density. Several strains of S. marcescens have previously been shown to possess an N -acyl- l -homoserine lactone (aHSL) QS system. This study aimed to determine the impact of introducing, by phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer, a biosynthetic gene cluster ( pig ) and a regulatory locus (aHSL QS) into strains lacking the respective trait. The pig cluster from S. marcescens ATCC 274 ( Sma 274) was transferred to the non-pigmented strain, S. marcescens strain 12 ( Sma 12). In the engineered strain, pigment was expressed and brought under the control of the recipient's native regulatory systems (aHSL QS and luxS ). Moreover, transfer of the aHSL locus from Sma 12 to the non-QS Sma 274 resulted in the imposition of aHSL control onto a variety of native traits, including pigment production. In addition, during this study, the QS regulon of the clinical strain, Sma 12, was characterized, and some novel QS-regulated traits in S. marcescens were identified. The results have implications for the evolution and dissemination of biosynthetic and QS loci, illustrating the genetic modularity and ease of acquisition of these traits and the capacity of phages to act as vectors for horizontal gene transfer."</span>

Deletion or repression of VacJ/Yrb increases OMV production in two distantly related Gram-negative bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae . Lipidome analyses demonstrate that OMVs from VacJ/Yrb-defective mutants in H. influenzae are enriched in phospholipids and certain fatty acids. Furthermore, we demonstrate that OMV production and regulation of the VacJ/Yrb ABC transport system respond to iron starvation. Our results suggest a new general mechanism of OMV biogenesis based on phospholipid accumulation in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane.

The present experiments explored the involvement of the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFCv) in mediating this “immunizing” or resilience producing effect of an initial experience with control. Behavioral immunization was blocked by inactivation of the mPFCv with muscimol at the time of the initial experience with control, as well as at the time of the later exposure to uncontrollable stress. Inhibition of protein synthesis within the mPFCv by anisomycin also blocked immunization when administered at the time of the initial controllable stress but had no effect when administered at the time of the later uncontrollable stress. Additional experiments found that the initial experience with control blocks the intense activation of serotonergic cells in the dorsal raphe nucleus that would normally be produced by uncontrollable stress, providing a mechanism for behavioral immunization. Furthermore, mPFCv activity during the initial controllable stressor was required for this effect to occur. These results suggest that the mPFCv is needed both to process information about the controllability of stressors and to utilize such information to regulate responses to subsequent stressors. Moreover, the mPFCv may be a site of storage or plasticity concerning controllability information.

A chemokine gradient was induced by placing a macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2)–containing (CXCL2) gel on the cremaster muscle of anesthetized wild-type mice or heparanase-overexpressing transgenic mice (hpa-tg) with truncated heparan sulfate (HS) side chains. Neutrophil-endothelial interactions were visualized by intravital microscopy and chemokine gradients detected by confocal microscopy. Localized extravascular chemokine release (MIP-2 gel) induced directed neutrophil crawling along a chemotactic gradient immobilized on the endothelium and accelerated their recruitment into the target tissue compared with homogeneous extravascular chemokine concentration (MIP-2 superfusion). Endothelial chemokine sequestration occurred exclusively in venules and was HS-dependent, and neutrophils in hpa-tg mice exhibited random crawling. Despite similar numbers of adherent neutrophils in hpa-tg and wild-type mice, the altered crawling in hpa-tg mice was translated into decreased number of emigrated neutrophils and ultimately decreased the ability to clear bacterial infections. In conclusion, an intravascular chemokine gradient sequestered by endothelial HS effectively directs crawling leukocytes toward transmigration loci close to the infection site."</span>

Here spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-β deposition, metabolism, vascular, functional activity at rest, structural properties, cognitive integrity and peripheral proteins levels are characterized in relation to LOAD progression. We analyse over 7,700 brain images and tens of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Through a multifactorial data-driven analysis, we obtain dynamic LOAD–abnormality indices for all biomarkers, and a tentative temporal ordering of disease progression. Imaging results suggest that intra-brain vascular dysregulation is an early pathological event during disease development. Cognitive decline is noticeable from initial LOAD stages, suggesting early memory deficit associated with the primary disease factors. High abnormality levels are also observed for specific proteins associated with the vascular system’s integrity. Although still subjected to the sensitivity of the algorithms and biomarkers employed, our results might contribute to the development of preventive therapeutic interventions."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"In a number of experimental systems in which lymphocyte depletion was induced by apoptosis-inducing manipulations, no apoptotic morphology and ladder-type DNA fragmentation were detected among freshly isolated peripheral lymphocytes ex vivo. Here we report that one alteration that can be detected among splenocytes stimulated with lymphocyte-depleting doses of dexamethasone (DEX) in vivo is a reduced uptake of 3,3'dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6[3]), a fluorochrome which incorporates into cells dependent upon their mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta psi m). In contrast, ex vivo isolated splenocytes still lacked established signs of programmed cell death (PCD):DNA degradation into high or low molecular weight fragments, ultrastructural changes of chromatin arrangement and endoplasmatic reticulum, loss in viability, or accumulation of intracellular peroxides. Moreover, no changes in cell membrane potential could be detected. A reduced delta psi m has been observed in response to different agents inducing lymphoid cell depletion in vivo (superantigen and glucocorticoids [GC]), in mature T and B lymphocytes, as well as their precursors. DEX treatment in vivo, followed by cytofluorometric purification of viable delta psi mlow splenic T cells ex vivo, revealed that this fraction of cells is irreversibly committed to undergoing DNA fragmentation. Immediately after purification neither delta psi mlow, nor delta psi mhigh cells, exhibit detectable DNA fragmentation. However, after short-term culture (37 degrees C, 1 h) delta psi mlow cells show endonucleolysis, followed by cytolysis several hours later. Incubation of delta psi mlow cells in the presence of excess amount of the GC receptor antagonist RU38486 (which displaces DEX from the GC receptor), cytokines that inhibit DEX-induced cell death, or cycloheximide fails to prevent cytolysis. The antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, as well as linomide, an agent that effectively inhibits DEX or superantigen-induced lymphocyte depletion in vivo, also stabilize the DiOC6(3) uptake. In contrast, the endonuclease inhibitor, aurintricarboxylic acid acts at later stages of apoptosis and only retards the transition from the viable delta psi mlow to the nonviable fraction. Altogether, these data suggest a sequence of PCD-associated events in which a reduction in delta psi m constitutes an obligate irreversible step of ongoing lymphocyte death, preceding other alterations of cellular physiology, and thus allowing for the ex vivo assessment of PCD."</span>

In an unbiased screen of more than 12,000 Drosophila lines, we identified a single gene, nemuri , that induces sleep. The NEMURI protein is an antimicrobial peptide that can be secreted ectopically to drive prolonged sleep (with resistance to arousal) and to promote survival after infection. Loss of nemuri increased arousability during daily sleep and attenuated the acute increase in sleep induced by sleep deprivation or bacterial infection. Conditions that increase sleep drive induced expression of nemuri in a small number of fly brain neurons and targeted it to the sleep-promoting, dorsal fan-shaped body. We propose that NEMURI is a bona fide sleep homeostasis factor that is particularly important under conditions of high sleep need; because these conditions include sickness, our findings provide a link between sleep and immune function."</span>

The function of the endocannabinoid system has been extensively studied in differentiated neurons, but its potential role in neural progenitor cells remains to be elucidated. Here we show that the CB 1 receptor and the endocannabinoid-inactivating enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase are expressed, both in vitro and in vivo , in postnatal radial glia (RC2 + cells) and in adult nestin type I (nestin + GFAP + ) neural progenitor cells. Cell culture experiments show that CB 1 receptor activation increases progenitor proliferation and differentiation into astroglial cells in vitro . In vivo analysis evidences that, in postnatal CB 1 −/− mouse brain, progenitor proliferation and astrogliogenesis are impaired. Likewise, in adult CB 1 -deficient mice, neural progenitor proliferation is decreased but is increased in fatty acid amide hydrolase-deficient mice. In addition, endocannabinoid signaling controls neural progenitor differentiation in the adult brain by promoting astroglial differentiation of newly born cells. These results show a novel physiological role of endocannabinoids, which constitute a new family of signaling cues involved in the regulation of neural progenitor cell function."</span>

By seeking genes whose expression is activated by the organizer-specific LIM homeobox gene Xlim-1 in Xenopusanimal caps, we isolated the receptor tyrosine kinase Xror2. Xror2 is expressed initially in the dorsal marginal zone, then in the notochord and the neuroectoderm posterior to the midbrain-hindbrain boundary. mRNA injection experiments revealed that overexpression of Xror2 inhibits convergent extension of the dorsal mesoderm and neuroectoderm in whole embryos, as well as the elongation of animal caps treated with activin, whereas it does not appear to affect cell differentiation of neural tissue and notochord. Interestingly, mutant constructs in which the kinase domain was point-mutated or deleted (named Xror2-TM) also inhibited convergent extension, and did not counteract the wild-type, suggesting that the ectodomain of Xror2 per se has activities that may be modulated by the intracellular domain. In relation to Wnt signaling for planar cell polarity, we observed: (1) the Frizzled-like domain in the ectodomain is required for the activity of wild-type Xror2 and Xror2-TM; (2) co-expression of Xror2 with Xwnt11, Xfz7, or both,synergistically inhibits convergent extension in embryos; (3) inhibition of elongation by Xror2 in activin-treated animal caps is reversed by co-expression of a dominant negative form of Cdc42 that has been suggested to mediate the planar cell polarity pathway of Wnt; and (4) the ectodomain of Xror2 interacts with Xwnts in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These results suggest that Xror2 cooperates with Wnts to regulate convergent extension of the axial mesoderm and neuroectoderm by modulating the planar cell polarity pathway of Wnt."</span>

These intervals include the uncertainty of the parameter estimates and variations in future rates but do not include the uncertainty of assumptions, such as continuation of current trends. In this study we evaluated whether prediction intervals are useful in practice. Methods Rates for the period 1993–97 were predicted from cancer incidence rates in the five Nordic countries for the period 1958–87. In a Poisson regression model, 95% prediction intervals were constructed for 200 combinations of 20 cancer types for males and females in the five countries. The coverage level was calculated as the proportion of the prediction intervals that covered the observed number of cases in 1993–97. Results Overall, 52% (104/200) of the prediction intervals covered the observed numbers. When the prediction intervals were divided into quartiles according to the number of cases in the last observed period, the coverage level was inversely proportional to the frequency (84%, 52%, 46% and 26%). The coverage level varied widely among the five countries, but the difference declined after adjustment for the number of cases in each country. Conclusion The coverage level of prediction intervals strongly depended on the number of cases on which the predictions were based. As the sample size increased, uncertainty about the adequacy of the model dominated, and the coverage level fell far below 95%. Prediction intervals for cancer incidence must therefore be interpreted with caution."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark in many eukaryotic organisms. De novo DNA methylation in plants can be achieved by the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway, where the plant-specific DNA-dependent RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) transcribes target sequences to initiate 24-nt siRNA production and action. The putative DNA binding protein DTF1/SHH1 of Arabidopsis has been shown to associate with Pol IV and is required for 24-nt siRNA accumulation and transcriptional silencing at several RdDM target loci. However, the extent and mechanism of DTF1 function in RdDM is unclear. We show here that DTF1 is necessary for the accumulation of the majority of Pol IV-dependent 24-nt siRNAs. It is also required for a large proportion of Pol IV-dependent de novo DNA methylation. Interestingly, there is a group of RdDM target loci where 24-nt siRNA accumulation but not DNA methylation is dependent on DTF1. DTF1 interacts directly with the chromatin remodeling protein CLASSY 1 (CLSY1), and both DTF1 and CLSY1 are associated in vivo with Pol IV but not Pol V, which functions downstream in the RdDM effector complex. DTF1 and DTF2 (a DTF1-like protein) contain a SAWADEE domain, which was found to bind specifically to histone H3 containing H3K9 methylation. Taken together, our results show that DTF1 is a core component of the RdDM pathway, and suggest that DTF1 interacts with CLSY1 to assist in the recruitment of Pol IV to RdDM target loci where H3K9 methylation may be an important feature. Our results also suggest the involvement of DTF1 in an important negative feedback mechanism for DNA methylation at some RdDM target loci."</span>

These sites were closely associated with gaps between pericytes and were preferentially used by migrating neutrophils during their passage through cytokine-stimulated venules. Although neutrophil transmigration did not alter the number/unit area of extracellular matrix protein low expression sites, the size of these regions was enlarged and their protein content was reduced in interleukin-1β–stimulated venules. These effects were entirely dependent on the presence of neutrophils and appeared to involve neutrophil-derived serine proteases. Furthermore, evidence was obtained indicating that transmigrating neutrophils carry laminins on their cell surface in vivo. Collectively, through identification of regions of low extracellular matrix protein localization that define the preferred route for transmigrating neutrophils, we have identified a plausible mechanism by which neutrophils penetrate the vascular BM without causing a gross disruption to its intricate structure."</span>

Our analysis revealed a core set of genes and pathways (e.g. central metabolism) that are predictive of antibiotic interactions. By identifying the interactions that are associated with orthologous genes, we successfully estimated drug‐interaction outcomes in the bacterial pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus, using the E. coli INDIGO model. INDIGO thus enables the discovery of effective combination therapies in less‐studied pathogens by leveraging chemogenomics data in model organisms."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract TGF-β1, β2 and β3 bind a common receptor to exert vastly diverse effects in cancer, supporting either tumor progression by favoring metastases and inhibiting anti-tumor immunity, or tumor suppression by inhibiting malignant cell proliferation. Global TGF-β inhibition thus bears the risk of undesired tumor-promoting effects. We show that selective blockade of TGF-β1 production by Tregs with antibodies against GARP:TGF-β1 complexes induces regressions of mouse tumors otherwise resistant to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Effects of combined GARP:TGF-β1/PD-1 blockade are immune-mediated, do not require FcγR-dependent functions and increase effector functions of anti-tumor CD8 + T cells without augmenting immune cell infiltration or depleting Tregs within tumors. We find GARP-expressing Tregs and evidence that they produce TGF-β1 in one third of human melanoma metastases.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract It is well established that host-associated microbial communities can interfere with the colonization and establishment of microbes of foreign origins, a phenomenon often referred to as bacterial interference or colonization resistance. However, due to the complexity of the indigenous microbiota, it has been extremely difficult to elucidate the community colonization resistance mechanisms and identify the bacterial species involved. In a recent study, we have established an in vitro mice oral microbial community (O-mix) and demonstrated its colonization resistance against an Escherichia coli strain of mice gut origin. In this study, we further analyzed the community structure of the O-mix by using a dilution/regrowth approach and identified the bacterial species involved in colonization resistance against E. coli. Our results revealed that, within the O-mix there were three different types of bacterial species forming unique social structure. They act as ‘Sensor’, ‘Mediator’ and ‘Killer’, respectively, and have coordinated roles in initiating the antagonistic action and preventing the integration of E. coli. The functional role of each identified bacterial species was further confirmed by E. coli-specific responsiveness of the synthetic communities composed of different combination of the identified players. The study reveals for the first time the sophisticated structural and functional organization of a colonization resistance pathway within a microbial community. Furthermore, our results emphasize the importance of ‘Facilitation’ or positive interactions in the development of community-level functions, such as colonization resistance."</span>

The RET /PTC1 type of rearrangement is an inversion of chromosome 10 mediated by illegitimate recombination between the RET and the H4 genes, which are 30 megabases apart. Here we ask whether despite the great linear distance between them, RET and H4 recombination might be promoted by their proximity in the nucleus. We used two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization and three-dimensional microscopy to map the positions of the RET and H4 loci within interphase nuclei. At least one pair of RET and H4 was juxtaposed in 35% of normal human thyroid cells and in 21% of peripheral blood lymphocytes, but only in 6% of normal mammary epithelial cells.

Considerable evidence suggests that Blimp1 is required for the establishment of anteroposterior axis formation and the formation of head structures during early vertebrate development. In mouse embryos, Blimp1 is strongly expressed in axial mesendoderm, the tissue known to provide anterior patterning signals during gastrulation. Here, we describe for the first time the defects caused by loss of Blimp1 function in the mouse. Blimp1 deficient embryos die at mid-gestation, but surprisingly early axis formation, anterior patterning and neural crest formation proceed normally. Rather, loss of Blimp1 expression disrupts morphogenesis of the caudal branchial arches and leads to a failure to correctly elaborate the labyrinthine layer of the placenta. Blimp1mutant embryos also show widespread blood leakage and tissue apoptosis, and,strikingly, Blimp1 homozygous mutants entirely lack PGCs. At the time of PGC allocation around 7.25 days post coitum, Blimp1 heterozygous embryos exhibit decreased numbers of PCGs. Thus Blimp1 probably acts to turn off the default pathway that allows epiblast cells to adopt a somatic cell fate, and shifts the transcriptional program so that they become exclusively allocated into the germ cell lineage."</span>

Fifteen mutations were nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site alterations predicted to result in truncated proteins lacking phosphatase activity. Five missense mutations in the most commonly altered PTP ( PTPRT ) were biochemically examined and found to reduce phosphatase activity.

In this paper, we provide evidence that BM endothelial cells (BMECs) also support multilineage hematopoiesis by elaboration of soluble cytokines. Hematopoietic progenitor cells incubated in direct contact with BMEC monolayers, or physically separated by microporous membrane, expanded five-fold to sevenfold at 7 days, in the absence of exogenous cytokines. Flow cytometric analysis of proliferating progenitor cells grown in the presence of BMEC monolayers showed that by day 14 of coculture, 70% to 80% of hematopoietic cells were myeloid, expressing CD15 or CD14, and 14% to 19% were megakaryocytic, expressing GPIIb/IIIa or GPIb. CD34+ cells derived from umbilical cord blood, cultured in the upper chamber of transwell culture plates, as well as the cells grown in direct contact with BMEC monolayers, generated progenitors for up to 70 days. Unstimulated BMEC monolayers constitutively produce interleukin-6, Kit- ligand, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Glutamate, released at a majority of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system, depolarizes neurons by acting at specific receptors. Its action is terminated by removal from the synaptic cleft mostly via Na(+)-dependent uptake systems located on both neurons and astrocytes. Here we report that glutamate, in addition to its receptor-mediated actions on neuronal excitability, stimulates glycolysis--i.e., glucose utilization and lactate production--in astrocytes. This metabolic action is mediated by activation of a Na(+)-dependent uptake system and not by interaction with receptors. The mechanism involves the Na+/K(+)-ATPase, which is activated by an increase in the intracellular concentration of Na+ cotransported with glutamate by the electrogenic uptake system. Thus, when glutamate is released from active synapses and taken up by astrocytes, the newly identified signaling pathway described here would provide a simple and direct mechanism to tightly couple neuronal activity to glucose utilization. In addition, glutamate-stimulated glycolysis is consistent with data obtained from functional brain imaging studies indicating local nonoxidative glucose utilization during physiological activation."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The mechanisms that regulate the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome system's own components, although critically important, are largely unknown. Ub, a principal component of the system, must be maintained at adequate levels to support cellular homeostasis under basal and stressed conditions. It was suggested that Ub is degraded as part of the polyubiquitin chain along with its substrate. Here, we demonstrate in a direct manner that Ub is indeed degraded in a “piggyback” mechanism. Also, it has been shown that monomeric Ub can be rapidly degraded when a C-terminal tail of a minimal length is fused to it. The tail, which may represent the substrate or part of it, or a naturally occurring extended form of Ub, probably allows entry of the protein into the 20S catalytic chamber, while Ub serves as an anchor to the 19S complex. Here, we show that shorter-tailed Ubs, such as UBB +1 , bind to the proteasome but because they cannot be efficiently degraded, they inhibit the degradation of other Ub system's substrates such as Myc, p21, Mdm2, and MyoD. The inhibition depends on the ability of the tailed Ubs to be ubiquitinated: their mere binding to the proteasome is not sufficient. Interestingly, the inhibition affects only substrates that must undergo ubiquitination for their degradation: ornithine decarboxylase that is targeted by the proteasome in a Ub-independent manner, is not affected by the short-tailed ubiquitinated Ubs, suggesting it binds to the 19S complex in a site different from that to which ubiquitinated substrates bind."</span>

Expression of PPARβ/δ mRNA and protein was lower and expression of CYCLIN D1 protein higher in human colon adenocarcinomas compared to matched non‐transformed tissue. Similar results were observed in colon tumors from Apc +/Min‐FCCC mice compared to control tissue. Dietary administration of sulindac to Apc +/Min‐FCCC mice had no influence on expression of PPARβ/δ in normal colon tissue or colon tumors. Cleaved poly (ADP‐ribose) polymerase (PARP) was either increased or unchanged, while expression of 14‐3‐3ε was not influenced in human colon cancer cell lines cultured with the PPARβ/δ ligand GW0742 under conditions known to increase apoptosis. While DLD1 cells exhibited fewer early apoptotic cells after ligand activation of PPARβ/δ following treatment with hydrogen peroxide, this change was associated with an increase in late apoptotic/necrotic cells, but not an increase in viable cells. Stable over‐expression of PPARβ/δ in human colon cancer cell lines enhanced ligand activation of PPARβ/δ and inhibition of clonogenicity in HT29 cells. These studies are the most quantitative to date to demonstrate that expression of PPARβ/δ is lower in human and Apc +/Min‐FCCC mouse colon tumors than in corresponding normal tissue, consistent with the finding that increasing expression and activation of PPARβ/δ in human colon cancer cell lines inhibits clonogenicity. Because ligand‐induced attenuation of early apoptosis can be associated with more late, apoptotic/necrotic cells, but not more viable cells, these studies illustrate why more comprehensive analysis of PPARβ/δ‐dependent modulation of apoptosis is required in the future. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."</span>

Inducible systems are invaluable when studying transcription because the regulatory process can be triggered instantaneously, allowing the tracking of ordered mechanistic events. Here, we use precision run-on sequencing (PRO-seq) to examine the genome-wide heat shock (HS) response in Drosophila and the function of two key transcription factors on the immediate transcription activation or repression of all genes regulated by HS. We identify the primary HS response genes and the rate-limiting steps in the transcription cycle that GAGA-associated factor (GAF) and HS factor (HSF) regulate. We demonstrate that GAF acts upstream of promoter-proximally paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) formation (likely at the step of chromatin opening) and that GAF-facilitated Pol II pausing is critical for HS activation. In contrast, HSF is dispensable for establishing or maintaining Pol II pausing but is critical for the release of paused Pol II into the gene body at a subset of highly activated genes. Additionally, HSF has no detectable role in the rapid HS repression of thousands of genes."</span>

To address this question, we used a mouse model of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) (TRβPV/PV mice). These mice, harboring a dominantly negative mutation (PV) of the thyroid hormone-β receptor (TRβ), exhibit increased serum thyroid hormone and elevated TSH. To eliminate TSH growth-stimulating effect, TRβPV/PV mice were crossed with TSH receptor gene knockout (TSHR−/−) mice. Wild-type siblings of TRβPV/PV mice were treated with an antithyroid agent, propylthiouracil, to elevate serum TSH for evaluating long-term TSH effect (WT-PTU mice). Thyroids from TRβPV/PVTSHR−/− showed impaired growth with no occurrence of FTC. Both WT-PTU and TRβPV/PV mice displayed enlarged thyroids, but only TRβPV/PV mice developed metastatic FTC. Molecular analyses indicate that PV acted, via multiple mechanisms, to activate the integrins-Src-focal adhesion kinase-p38 MAPK pathway and affect cytoskeletal restructuring to increase tumor cell migration and invasion. Thus, growth stimulated by TSH is a prerequisite but not sufficient for metastatic cancer to occur. Additional genetic alterations (such as PV), destined to alter focal adhesion and migration capacities, are required to empower hyperplastic follicular cells to invade and metastasize.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (Pcsk9) is a subtilisin serine protease with a putative role in cholesterol metabolism. Pcsk9 expression is down-regulated by dietary cholesterol, and mutations in Pcsk9 have been associated with a form of autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia. To study the function of Pcsk9 in mice, an adenovirus constitutively expressing murine Pcsk9 (Pcsk9-Ad) was used. Pcsk9 overexpression in wild-type mice caused a 2-fold increase in plasma total cholesterol and a 5-fold increase in non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, with no increase in HDL cholesterol, as compared with mice infected with a control adenovirus. Fast protein liquid chromatography analysis showed that the increase in non-HDL cholesterol was due to an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This effect appeared to depend on the LDL receptor (LDLR) because LDLR knockout mice infected with Pcsk9-Ad had no change in plasma cholesterol levels as compared with knockout mice infected with a control adenovirus. Furthermore, whereas overexpression of Pcsk9 had no effect on LDLR mRNA levels, there was a near absence of LDLR protein in animals overexpressing Pcsk9. These results were confirmed in vitro by the demonstration that transfection of Pcsk9 in McA-RH7777 cells caused a reduction in LDLR protein and LDL binding. In summary, these results indicate that overexpression of Pcsk9 interferes with LDLR-mediated LDL cholesterol uptake. Because Pcsk9 and LDLR are coordinately regulated by cholesterol, Pcsk9 may be involved in a novel mechanism to modulate LDLR function by an alternative pathway than classic cholesterol inhibition of sterol regulatory element binding protein-mediated transcription."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"There are distinctive and characteristic genomic modifications in primordial germ cells that distinguish the germ cell lineage from somatic cells. These modifications include, genome-wide demethylation, erasure of allele-specific methylation associated with imprinted genes, and the re-activation of the X chromosome. The allele-specific differential methylation is involved in regulating the monoallelic expression, and thus the gene dosage, of imprinted genes, which underlies functional differences between parental genomes. However, when the imprints are erased in the germ line, the parental genomes acquire an equivalent epigenetic and functional state. Therefore, one of the reasons why primordial germ cells are unique is because this is the only time in mammals when the distinction between parental genomes ceases to exist. To test how the potentially imprint-free primordial germ cell nuclei affect embryonic development, we transplanted them into enucleated oocytes. Here we show that the reconstituted oocyte developed to day 9.5 of gestation, consistently as a small embryo and a characteristic abnormal placenta. The embryo proper also did not progress much further even when the inner cell mass was ‘rescued’ from the abnormal placenta by transfer into a tetraploid host blastocyst. We found that development of the experimental conceptus was affected, at least in part, by a lack of gametic imprints, as judged by DNA methylation and expression analysis of several imprinted genes. The evidence suggests that gametic imprints are essential for normal development, and that they can neither be initiated nor erased in mature oocytes; these properties are unique to the developing germ line."</span>

HsORC binds preferentially to synthetic AT-rich polydeoxynucleotides, but does not effectively discriminate between natural DNA fragments that contain known human origins and control fragments. The complex fully restores DNA replication to ORC-depleted Xenopus egg extracts, providing strong evidence for its initiator function. Strikingly, HsORC stimulates initiation from any DNA sequence, and it does not preferentially replicate DNA containing human origin sequences.

In this work, we evaluated by RNA interference the relevance to rotavirus assembly and infectivity of grp78, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), grp94, calnexin, calreticulin, and ERp57, members of the two ER folding systems described herein. Silencing the expression of grp94 and Erp57 had no effect on rotavirus infectivity, while knocking down the expression of any of the other four chaperons caused a reduction in the yield of infectious virus of about 50%. In grp78-silenced cells, the maturation of the oligosaccharide chains of NSP4 was retarded. In cells with reduced levels of calnexin, the oxidative folding of VP7 was impaired and the trimming of NSP4 was accelerated, and in calreticulin-silenced cells, the formation of disulfide bonds of VP7 was also accelerated. The knockdown of PDI impaired the formation and/or rearrangement of the VP7 disulfide bonds. All these conditions also affected the correct assembly of virus particles, since compared with virions from control cells, they showed an altered susceptibility to EGTA and heat treatments, a decreased specific infectivity, and a diminished reactivity to VP7 with monoclonal antibody M60, which recognizes only this protein when its disulfide bonds have been correctly formed. In the case of grp78-silenced cells, the virus produced bound less efficiently to MA104 cells than virus obtained from control cells. All these results suggest that these chaperones are involved in the quality control of rotavirus morphogenesis. The complexity of the steps of rotavirus assembly that occur in the ER provide a useful model for studying the organization and operation of the complex network of chaperones involved in maintaining the quality control of this organelle."</span>

Recent studies on this topic have made significant progress, yet are mainly focused on using organic polymers. This set of photocatalysts is susceptible to potent oxidants (e.g. hydroxyl radical) that are inevitably formed during H 2 O 2 generation. Here, we report an inorganic Mo-doped faceted BiVO 4 (Mo:BiVO 4 ) system that is resistant to radical oxidation and exhibits a high overall H 2 O 2 photosynthesis efficiency among inorganic photocatalysts, with an apparent quantum yield of 1.2% and a solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency of 0.29% at full spectrum, as well as an apparent quantum yield of 5.8% at 420 nm. The surface-reaction kinetics and selectivity of Mo:BiVO 4 were tuned by precisely loading CoO x and Pd on {110} and {010} facets, respectively. Time-resolved spectroscopic investigations of photocarriers suggest that depositing select cocatalysts on distinct facet tailored the interfacial energetics between {110} and {010} facets and enhanced charge separation in Mo:BiVO 4 , therefore overcoming a key challenge in developing efficient inorganic photocatalysts. The promising H 2 O 2 generation efficiency achieved by delicate design of catalyst spatial and electronic structures sheds light on applying robust inorganic particulate photocatalysts to artificial photosynthesis of H 2 O 2 ."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The specialized protein synthesis functions of the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum compartments are conferred by the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway, which directs the cotranslational trafficking of signal sequence-encoding mRNAs from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although subcellular mRNA distributions largely mirror the binary pattern predicted by the SRP pathway model, studies in mammalian cells, yeast, and Drosophila have also demonstrated that cytosolic protein-encoding mRNAs are broadly represented on ER-bound ribosomes. A mechanism for such noncanonical mRNA localization remains, however, to be identified. Here, we examine the hypothesis that de novo translation initiation on ER-bound ribosomes serves as a mechanism for localizing cytosolic protein-encoding mRNAs to the ER. As a test of this hypothesis, we performed single molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization studies of subcellular mRNA distributions and report that a substantial fraction of mRNAs encoding the cytosolic protein GAPDH resides in close proximity to the ER. Consistent with these data, analyses of subcellular mRNA and ribosome distributions in multiple cell lines demonstrated that cytosolic protein mRNA-ribosome distributions were strongly correlated, whereas signal sequence-encoding mRNA-ribosome distributions were divergent. Ribosome footprinting studies of ER-bound polysomes revealed a substantial initiation codon read density enrichment for cytosolic protein-encoding mRNAs. We also demonstrate that eukaryotic initiation factor 2α is bound to the ER via a salt-sensitive, ribosome-independent mechanism. Combined, these data support ER-localized translation initiation as a mechanism for mRNA recruitment to the ER."</span>

They are generated in the trans-Golgi network as immature secretory granules, short-lived vesicular intermediates, which undergo a complex and poorly understood maturation process. Due to their short half-life and low abundance, real-time studies of immature secretory granules have not been previously possible. We describe here a pulse/chase-like system based on the expression of a human chromogranin B-GFP fusion protein in neuroendocrine PC12 cells, which permits direct visualization of the budding of immature secretory granules and their dynamics during maturation. Live cell imaging revealed that newly formed immature secretory granules are transported in a direct and microtubule-dependent manner within a few seconds to the cell periphery. Our data suggest that the cooperative action of microtubules and actin filaments restricts immature secretory granules to the F-actin-rich cell cortex, where they move randomly and mature completely within a few hours. During this maturation period, secretory granules segregate into pools of different motility. In a late phase of maturation, 60% of secretory granules were found to be immobile and about half of these underwent F-actin-dependent tethering."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"ABSTRACT Environmental contamination with compounds containing oxyanions of chlorine, such as perchlorate or chlorate [(per)chlorate] or chlorine dioxide, has been a constantly growing problem over the last 100 years. Although the fact that microbes reduce these compounds has been recognized for more than 50 years, only six organisms which can obtain energy for growth by this metabolic process have been described. As part of a study to investigate the diversity and ubiquity of microorganisms involved in the microbial reduction of (per)chlorate, we enumerated the (per)chlorate-reducing bacteria (ClRB) in very diverse environments, including pristine and hydrocarbon-contaminated soils, aquatic sediments, paper mill waste sludges, and farm animal waste lagoons. In all of the environments tested, the acetate-oxidizing ClRB represented a significant population, whose size ranged from 2.31 × 10 3 to 2.4 × 10 6 cells per g of sample. In addition, we isolated 13 ClRB from these environments. All of these organisms could grow anaerobically by coupling complete oxidation of acetate to reduction of (per)chlorate. Chloride was the sole end product of this reductive metabolism. All of the isolates could also use oxygen as a sole electron acceptor, and most, but not all, could use nitrate. The alternative electron donors included simple volatile fatty acids, such as propionate, butyrate, or valerate, as well as simple organic acids, such as lactate or pyruvate. Oxidized-minus-reduced difference spectra of washed whole-cell suspensions of the isolates had absorbance maxima close to 425, 525, and 550 nm, which are characteristic of type c cytochromes. In addition, washed cell suspensions of all of the ClRB isolates could dismutate chlorite, an intermediate in the reductive metabolism of (per)chlorate, into chloride and molecular oxygen. Chlorite dismutation was a result of the activity of a single enzyme which in pure form had a specific activity of approximately 1,928 μmol of chlorite per mg of protein per min. Analyses of the 16S ribosomal DNA sequences of the organisms indicated that they all belonged to the alpha, beta, or gamma subclass of the Proteobacteria . Several were closely related to members of previously described genera that are not recognized for the ability to reduce (per)chlorate, such as the genera Pseudomonas and Azospirllum . However, many were not closely related to any previously described organism and represented new genera within the Proteobacteria . The results of this study significantly increase the limited number of microbial isolates that are known to be capable of dissimilatory (per)chlorate reduction and demonstrate the hitherto unrecognized phylogenetic diversity and ubiquity of the microorganisms that exhibit this type of metabolism."</span>

Switching between phenotypic forms (or ‘phases’) that favour asymptomatic carriage or invasive disease was first reported in 1933. Here, we show that the underlying mechanism for such phase variation consists of genetic rearrangements in a Type I restriction-modification system (SpnD39III). The rearrangements generate six alternative specificities with distinct methylation patterns, as defined by single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) methylomics. The SpnD39III variants have distinct gene expression profiles. We demonstrate distinct virulence in experimental infection and in vivo selection for switching between SpnD39III variants. SpnD39III is ubiquitous in pneumococci, indicating an essential role in its biology. Future studies must recognize the potential for switching between these heretofore undetectable, differentiated pneumococcal subpopulations in vitro and in vivo .

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Ubiquitination controls a broad range of cellular functions. The last step of the ubiquitination pathway is regulated by enzyme type 3 (E3) ubiquitin ligases. E3 enzymes are responsible for substrate specificity and catalyze the formation of an isopeptide bond between a lysine residue of the substrate (or the N terminus of the substrate) and ubiquitin. MIR1 and MIR2 are two E3 ubiquitin ligases encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma–associated herpesvirus that mediate the ubiquitination of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules and subsequent internalization. Here, we found that MIR1, but not MIR2, promoted down-regulation of MHC I molecules lacking lysine residues in their intracytoplasmic domain. In the presence of MIR1, these MHC I molecules were ubiquitinated, and their association with ubiquitin was sensitive to β 2 -mercaptoethanol, unlike lysine-ubiquitin bonds. This form of ubiquitination required a cysteine residue in the intracytoplasmic tail of MHC I molecules. An MHC I molecule containing a single cysteine residue in an artificial glycine and alanine intracytoplasmic domain was endocytosed and degraded in the presence of MIR1. Thus, ubiquitination can occur on proteins lacking accessible lysines or an accessible N terminus."</span>

These leukemias are classified either as T prolymphocytic leukemias, which occur very late in life, or as T chronic lymphocytic leukemias, which often arise in patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT) at a young age. In transgenic animals, the deregulated expression of TCL1 leads to mature T cell leukemia, demonstrating the role of TCL1 in the initiation of malignant transformation in T cell neoplasia. Expression of high levels of Tcl1 have also been found in a variety of human tumor-derived B cell lines ranging from pre-B cell to mature B cell. Here we describe the phenotype of transgenic mice, Eμ- TCL1 , established with TCL1 under the control of a V H promoter-Ig H -Eμ enhancer to target TCL1 expression to immature and mature B cells. Flow cytometric analysis reveals a markedly expanded CD5 + population in the peritoneal cavity of Eμ- TCL1 mice starting at 2 mo of age that becomes evident in the spleen by 3–5 mo and in the bone marrow by 5–8 mo. Analysis of Ig gene rearrangements indicates monoclonality or oligoclonality in these populations, suggesting a preneoplastic expansion of CD5 + B cell clones, with the elder mice eventually developing a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)-like disorder resembling human B-CLL.

Consistent with this hypothesis, previous studies of individual DP domains indicated that the DP COOH terminus associates with IF networks whereas NH2-terminal sequences govern the association of DP with the desmosomal plaque. Nevertheless, it had not yet been demonstrated that DP is required for attaching IF to the desmosome. To test this proposal directly, we generated A431 cell lines stably expressing DP NH2-terminal polypeptides, which were expected to compete with endogenous DP during desmosome assembly. As these polypeptides lacked the COOH-terminal IF-binding domain, this competition should result in the loss of IF anchorage if DP is required for linking IF to the desmosomal plaque. In such cells, a 70-kD DP NH2-terminal polypeptide (DP-NTP) colocalized at cell-cell interfaces with desmosomal proteins. As predicted, the distribution of endogenous DP was severely perturbed. At cell-cell borders where endogenous DP was undetectable by immunofluorescence, there was a striking absence of attached tonofibrils (IF bundles). Furthermore, DP-NTP assembled into ultrastructurally identifiable junctional structures lacking associated IF bundles. Surprisingly, immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy indicated that adherens junction components were coassembled into these structures along with desmosomal components and DP-NTP. These results indicate that DP is required for anchoring IF networks to desmosomes and furthermore suggest that the DP-IF complex is important for governing the normal spatial segregation of adhesive junction components during their assembly into distinct structures."</span>

We parameterised our allometric trophic network model of 24 guilds and 107 feeding relationships using the lake’s food web structure, initial spring biomasses and body‐masses. Adding activity respiration, the detrital loop, minimal abiotic forcing, prey resistance and several empirically observed rates substantially increased the model's fit to the observed seasonal dynamics and the size‐abundance distribution.

In the present study we sought to determine whether mesolimbic dopamine neurons are involved in the neurobiologic mechanisms underlying withdrawal from chronic cannabinoid exposure. Rats were treated chronically with the major psychoactive ingredient of hashish and marijuana, Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ 9 -THC). Administration of the cannabinoid antagonist SR 141716A precipitated an intense behavioral withdrawal syndrome, whereas abrupt Δ 9 -THC suspension failed to produce overt signs of abstinence. In contrast, both groups showed a reduction in dopamine cells activity as indicated by extracellular single unit recordings from antidromically identified meso-accumbens dopamine neurons. The administration of Δ 9 -THC to spontaneously withdrawn rats restored neuronal activity. Conversely, SR 141716A produced a further decrease of spontaneous activity in cannabinoid-treated although it was ineffective in control rats. These data indicate that withdrawal from chronic cannabinoid administration is associated with reduced dopaminergic transmission in the limbic system, similar to that observed with other addictive drugs; these changes in neuronal plasticity may play a role in drug craving and relapse into drug addiction."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The linked IL-4 and IL-13 cytokine genes, which are activated and silenced in T helper (Th) 2 and Th1 cells, respectively, are flanked by the equivalently expressed RAD50 and KIF3A genes. A scan of DNase I hypersensitivity and DNA methylation across ≈100 kb of the KIF3A / IL-4 / IL-13 / RAD50 cluster revealed differences in chromatin structure between Th1 and Th2 cells at the 3′ end of the RAD50 gene, a region previously shown to contain a locus control region (LCR) regulating Th2-specific expression of IL-4 and IL-13 . Naïve CD4 T cells did not exhibit any DNase I hypersensitivity in this region, but stimulation under either Th1 or Th2 conditions caused rapid development of three hypersensitive sites. An additional hypersensitive site developed rapidly only under Th2 conditions, through a mechanism dependent on signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 (STAT6) but not GATA3. Our data point to a physical separation in the actions of STAT6 and its downstream effector GATA3 during Th2 differentiation: STAT6 directly remodels the RAD50 LCR, whereas GATA3 acts only in the vicinity of the IL-4 gene. We suggest that the RAD50 LCR has a complex and dual role in Th1 and Th2 differentiation, communicating early T cell antigen receptor and cytokine signals to the IL-4 / IL-13 locus in both differentiating cell types."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Significance Retroviruses copy their RNA genome into complementary DNA, which is then inserted into the host chromosomal DNA as an obligatory part of their life cycle. Such integrated viral sequences, called proviruses, are passed to the infected cell progeny on cellular division. If germline cells are targeted, the proviruses become vertically inherited as other host genes and are called endogenous retroviruses. Deltaretroviruses, which include important human and veterinary pathogens (HTLV-1 and BLV), are the last retroviral genus for which endogenous forms were not known. We have identified a case of endogenous Deltaretrovirus, which entered the genome of long-fingered bat ancestors more than 20 million years ago. This finding opens the way for elucidating the deep evolutionary history of deltaretroviruses."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The current dopamine (DA) hypothesis of schizophrenia postulates striatal hyperdopaminergia and cortical hypodopaminergia. Although partial agonists at DA D2 receptors (D2Rs), like aripiprazole, were developed to simultaneously target both phenomena, they do not effectively improve cortical dysfunction. In this study, we investigate the potential for newly developed β-arrestin2 (βarr2)-biased D2R partial agonists to simultaneously target hyper- and hypodopaminergia. Using neuron-specific βarr2-KO mice, we show that the antipsychotic-like effects of a βarr2-biased D2R ligand are driven through both striatal antagonism and cortical agonism of D2R-βarr2 signaling. Furthermore, βarr2-biased D2R agonism enhances firing of cortical fast-spiking interneurons. This enhanced cortical agonism of the biased ligand can be attributed to a lack of G-protein signaling and elevated expression of βarr2 and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase 2 in the cortex versus the striatum. Therefore, we propose that βarr2-biased D2R ligands that exert region-selective actions could provide a path to develop more effective antipsychotic therapies."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers innate immune responses through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, a member of the TLR family that participates in pathogen recognition. TLRs recruit a cytoplasmic protein, MyD88, upon pathogen recognition, mediating its function for immune responses. Two major pathways for LPS have been suggested in recent studies, which are referred to as MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways. We report in this study the characterization of the MyD88-independent pathway via TLR4. MyD88-deficient cells failed to produce inflammatory cytokines in response to LPS, whereas they responded to LPS by activating IFN-regulatory factor 3 as well as inducing the genes containing IFN-stimulated regulatory elements such as IP-10. In contrast, a lipopeptide that activates TLR2 had no ability to activate IFN-regulatory factor 3. The MyD88-independent pathway was also activated in cells lacking both MyD88 and TNFR-associated factor 6. Thus, TLR4 signaling is composed of at least two distinct pathways, a MyD88-dependent pathway that is critical to the induction of inflammatory cytokines and a MyD88/TNFR-associated factor 6-independent pathway that regulates induction of IP-10."</span>

At brp mutant active zones, electron-dense projections (T-bars) were entirely lost, Ca 2+ channels were reduced in density, evoked vesicle release was depressed, and short-term plasticity was altered.

If and how mathematical rules can be represented by single neurons, however, has remained elusive. We therefore recorded the activity of individual prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons in rhesus monkeys required to switch flexibly between “greater than” and “less than” rules. The monkeys performed this task with different numerical quantities and generalized to set sizes that had not been presented previously, indicating that they had learned an abstract mathematical principle. The most prevalent activity recorded from randomly selected PFC neurons reflected the mathematical rules; purely sensory- and memory-related activity was almost absent. These data show that single PFC neurons have the capacity to represent flexible operations on most abstract numerical quantities. Our findings support PFC network models implementing specific “rule-coding” units that control the flow of information between segregated input, memory, and output layers. We speculate that these neuronal circuits in the monkey lateral PFC could readily have been adopted in the course of primate evolution for syntactic processing of numbers in formalized mathematical systems."</span>

The current leading candidate, RTS,S, is a recombinant circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-based vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum that contains 19 NANP repeats followed by a thrombospondin repeat domain. Although RTS,S has undergone extensive clinical testing and has progressed through phase III clinical trials, continued efforts are underway to enhance its efficacy and duration of protection. Here, we determined that two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs 311 and 317), isolated from a recent controlled human malaria infection trial exploring a delayed fractional dose, inhibit parasite development in vivo by at least 97%. Crystal structures of antibody fragments (Fabs) 311 and 317 with an (NPNA) 3 peptide illustrate their different binding modes. Notwithstanding, one and three of the three NPNA repeats adopt similar well-defined type I β-turns with Fab311 and Fab317, respectively. Furthermore, to explore antibody binding in the context of P. falciparum CSP, we used negative-stain electron microscopy on a recombinant shortened CSP (rsCSP) construct saturated with Fabs. Both complexes display a compact rsCSP with multiple Fabs bound, with the rsCSP–Fab311 complex forming a highly organized helical structure. Together, these structural insights may aid in the design of a next-generation malaria vaccine."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The building blocks of a virus derived from de novo biosynthesis during infection and/or catabolism of preexisting host cell biomass, and the relative contribution of these 2 sources has important consequences for understanding viral biogeochemistry. We determined the uptake of extracellular nitrogen (N) and its biosynthetic incorporation into both virus and host proteins using an isotope-labeling proteomics approach in a model marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus WH8102 infected by a lytic cyanophage S-SM1. By supplying dissolved N as 15 N postinfection, we found that proteins in progeny phage particles were composed of up to 41% extracellularly derived N, while proteins of the infected host cell showed almost no isotope incorporation, demonstrating that de novo amino acid synthesis continues during infection and contributes specifically and substantially to phage replication. The source of N for phage protein synthesis shifted over the course of infection from mostly host derived in the early stages to more medium derived later on. We show that the photosystem II reaction center proteins D1 and D2, which are auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) in the S-SM1 genome, are made de novo during infection in an apparently light-dependent manner. We also identified a small set of host proteins that continue to be produced during infection; the majority are homologs of AMGs in S-SM1 or other viruses, suggesting selective continuation of host protein production during infection. The continued acquisition of nutrients by the infected cell and their utilization for phage replication are significant for both evolution and biogeochemical impact of viruses."</span>

The widely held view is that these antiangiogenic therapies should destroy the tumor vasculature, thereby depriving the tumor of oxygen and nutrients. Here, I review emerging evidence supporting an alternative hypothesis—that certain antiangiogenic agents can also transiently “normalize” the abnormal structure and function of tumor vasculature to make it more efficient for oxygen and drug delivery. Drugs that induce vascular normalization can alleviate hypoxia and increase the efficacy of conventional therapies if both are carefully scheduled. A better understanding of the molecular and cellular underpinnings of vascular normalization may ultimately lead to more effective therapies not only for cancer but also for diseases with abnormal vasculature, as well as regenerative medicine, in which the goal is to create and maintain a functionally normal vasculature."</span>

Data herein show B cells from obese mice produce a proinflammatory cytokine profile compared with B cells from lean mice. Complementary in vivo studies show that obese B cell–null mice have decreased systemic inflammation, inflammatory B- and T-cell cytokines, adipose tissue inflammation, and insulin resistance (IR) compared with obese WT mice. Reduced inflammation in obese/insulin resistant B cell–null mice associates with an increased percentage of anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs). This increase contrasts with the sharply decreased percentage of Tregs in obese compared with lean WT mice and suggests that B cells may be critical regulators of T-cell functions previously shown to play important roles in IR. We demonstrate that B cells from T2D (but not non-T2D) subjects support proinflammatory T-cell function in obesity/T2D through contact-dependent mechanisms. In contrast, human monocytes increase proinflammatory T-cell cytokines in both T2D and non-T2D analyses. These data support the conclusion that B cells are critical regulators of inflammation in T2D due to their direct ability to promote proinflammatory T-cell function and secrete a proinflammatory cytokine profile.

In contrast, the proposed grading system of possible, probable, and definite neuropathic pain from 2008 has been used to a lesser extent. Here, we report a citation analysis of the original NeuPSIG grading paper of 2008, followed by an analysis of its use by an expert panel and recommendations for an improved grading system. As of February, 2015, 608 eligible articles in Scopus cited the paper, 414 of which cited the neuropathic pain definition. Of 220 clinical studies citing the paper, 56 had used the grading system. The percentage using the grading system increased from 5% in 2009 to 30% in 2014. Obstacles to a wider use of the grading system were identified, including (1) questions about the relative significance of confirmatory tests, (2) the role of screening tools, and (3) uncertainties about what is considered a neuroanatomically plausible pain distribution. Here, we present a revised grading system with an adjusted order, better reflecting clinical practice, improvements in the specifications, and a word of caution that even the “definite” level of neuropathic pain does not always indicate causality. In addition, we add a table illustrating the area of pain and sensory abnormalities in common neuropathic pain conditions and propose areas for further research."</span>

As the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins are expressed in the microvilli of many epithelial cells, we have examined the expression and distribution of these proteins in Schwann cells and neurons in vitro and in vivo . Cultured Schwann cells express high levels of all three proteins and the ezrin-binding protein 50, whereas neurons express much lower, although detectable, levels of radixin and moesin. Ezrin is specific for Schwann cells. All three ERM proteins are expressed predominantly at the membrane of cultured Schwann cells, notably in their microvilli. In vivo , the ERM proteins are concentrated strikingly in the nodal processes of myelinating Schwann cells. Because these processes are devoid of myelin proteins, they represent a unique compartment of the myelinating Schwann cell. During development, the ERM proteins become concentrated at the ends of Schwann cells before myelin basic protein expression, demonstrating that Schwann cells are polarized longitudinally at the onset of myelination. ERM-positive Schwann cell processes overlie and are associated closely with nascent nodes of Ranvier, identified by clusters of ankyrin G. Ankyrin accumulation at the node precedes that of Caspr at the paranodes and therefore does not depend on the presence of mature paranodal junctions.

LC3, a homologue of yeast Atg8, takes part in autophagosome formation, but the exact regulation mechanism of LC3 still needs to be elucidated. Methods Ceramide-induced autophagy was determined by detecting LC3 expression with Western blotting and confocal microscopy in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines CNE2 and SUNE1. The activation of JNK pathway was assessed by Western blotting for phospho-specific forms of JNK and c-Jun. The JNK activity specific inhibitor, SP600125, and siRNA directed against JNK were used to block JNK/c-Jun pathway. ChIP and luciferase reporter analysis were applied to determine whether c-Jun was involved in the regulation of LC3 transcription. Results Ceramide-treated cells exhibited the characteristics of autophagy and JNK pathway activation. Inhibition of JNK pathway could block the ceramide-induced autophagy and the up-regulation of LC3 expression.

Here, we propose a simple procedure to extract kinetic information from such experiments. The cornerstone of our method is a transformation of the rupture-force histograms obtained at different force-loading rates into the force-dependent lifetimes measurable in constant-force experiments. To interpret the force-dependent lifetimes, we derive a generalization of Bell's formula that is formally exact within the framework of Kramers theory. This result complements the analytical expression for the lifetime that we derived previously for a class of model potentials. We illustrate our procedure by analyzing the nanopore unzipping of DNA hairpins and the unfolding of a protein attached by flexible linkers to an atomic force microscope. Our procedure to transform rupture-force histograms into the force-dependent lifetimes remains valid even when the molecular extension is a poor reaction coordinate and higher-dimensional free-energy surfaces must be considered. In this case the microscopic interpretation of the lifetimes becomes more challenging because the lifetimes can reveal richer, and even nonmonotonic, dependence on the force."</span>

Airn expression is necessary to initiate paternal-specific silencing of the Igf2r gene, which is followed by gain of a somatic DNA methylation imprint on the silent Igf2r promoter. However, the developmental requirements for Airn initiation of Igf2r silencing and the role of Airn or DNA methylation in maintaining stable Igf2r repression have not been investigated. Here, we use inducible systems to control Airn expression during mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. By turning Airn expression off during ESC differentiation, we show that continuous Airn expression is needed to maintain Igf2r silencing, but only until the paternal Igf2r promoter is methylated. By conditionally turning Airn expression on, we show that Airn initiation of Igf2r silencing is not limited to one developmental ‘window of opportunity’ and can be maintained in the absence of DNA methylation.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Bacteriophage T7 DNA helicase is a ring-shaped hexamer that catalyzes duplex DNA unwinding using dTTP hydrolysis as an energy source. Of the six potential nucleotide binding sites on the hexamer, we have found that three are noncatalytic sites and three are catalytic sites. The noncatalytic sites bind nucleotides with a high affinity, but dTTPs bound to these sites do not dissociate or hydrolyze through many dTTPase turnovers at the catalytic sites. The catalytic sites show strong cooperativity which leads to sequential binding and hydrolysis of dTTP. The elucidated dTTPase mechanism of the catalytic sites of T7 helicase is remarkably similar to the binding change mechanism of the ATP synthase. Based on the similarity, a general mechanism for hexameric helicases is proposed. In this mechanism, an F 1 -ATPase-like rotational movement around the single-stranded DNA, which is bound through the central hole of the hexamer, is proposed to lead to unidirectional translocation along single-stranded DNA and duplex DNA unwinding."</span>

The transcriptional repressor BCL6 is required for TFH responses, but the kinetics of BCL6 protein expression in activated CD4+ T cells have not been established. We measured BCL6 expression during TFH cell development at the single-cell level using intracellular staining and YFP-BCL6 fusion protein reporter mice. BCL6 was immediately upregulated in all dividing T cells during dendritic cell–T cell interactions. A second wave of early BCL6 expression coincided with the induction of CXCR5, resulting in a distinct and stable TFH cell population. Cognate B cells were not required for the induction of BCL6, but supported the expansion of TFH cells.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Activator protein-1 (AP-1) is a transcription factor that consists of either a Jun-Jun homodimer or a Jun-Fos heterodimer. Transactivation of AP-1 is required for tumor promoter-induced transformation in mouse epidermal JB6 cells and for progression in mouse and human keratinocytes. Until now, the question of whether AP-1 transactivation is required for carcinogenesis in vivo has remained unanswered, as has the issue of functionally significant target genes. To address these issues we have generated a transgenic mouse in which transactivation mutant c-jun (TAM67), under the control of the human keratin-14 promoter, is expressed specifically in the basal cells of the epidermis where tumor induction is initiated. The keratin-14–TAM67 transgene was expressed in the epidermis, tongue, and cervix, with no apparent abnormalities in any tissue or organ. TAM67 expression blocked 12- O -tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA, phorbol 12-tetradecanoate 13-acetate) induction of the AP-1-regulated luciferase in AP-1 luciferase/TAM67 mice, but did not inhibit induction of candidate AP-1 target genes, collagenase-1 or stromelysin-3. More interestingly, TAM67 expression did not inhibit TPA-induced hyperproliferation. In two-stage skin carcinogenesis experiments, the transgenic animals showed a dramatic inhibition of papilloma induction. We conclude that transactivation of a subset of AP-1-dependent genes is required for tumor promotion and may be targeted for cancer prevention."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract The relentless adaptability of pathogen populations is a major obstacle to effective disease control measures. Increasing evidence suggests that gene transcriptional polymorphisms are a strategy deployed by pathogens to evade host immunity. However, the underlying mechanisms of transcriptional plasticity remain largely elusive. Here we found that the soybean root rot pathogen Phytophthora sojae evades the soybean Resistance gene Rps1b through transcriptional polymorphisms in the effector gene Avr1b that occur in the absence of any sequence variation. Elevated levels of histone H3 Lysine27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) were observed at the Avr1b locus in a naturally occurring Avr1b-silenced strain but not in an Avr1b-expressing strain, suggesting a correlation between this epigenetic modification and silencing of Avr1b. To genetically test this hypothesis, we edited the gene, PsSu(z)12, encoding a core subunit of the H3K27me3 methyltransferase complex by using CRISPR/Cas9, and obtained three deletion mutants. H3K27me3 depletion within the Avr1b genomic region correlated with impaired Avr1b gene silencing in these mutants. Importantly, these mutants lost the ability to evade immune recognition by soybeans carrying Rps1b. These data support a model in which pathogen effector transcriptional polymorphisms are associated with changes in chromatin epigenetic marks, highlighting epigenetic variation as a mechanism of pathogen adaptive plasticity."</span>

Several studies have shown that in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) patients, the disease outcome is determined by a complex interaction between the virus and immunopathologic and human genetic factors. In Slovenia, the severity of the disease caused by Puumala virus (PUUV) is significantly lower than that of HFRS due to Dobrava virus (DOBV). We have determined 23 different HLA-B and 12 different HLA-DRB1 types in Slovenian HFRS patients. Comparison of HLA frequencies between healthy individuals and HFRS patients showed no strong association with the susceptibility for hantaviral infection. Significant associations were recognized when the patient group was separated according to the virus responsible for the infection. DOBV-infected patients have a significantly higher frequency of HLA-B*35 than PUUV-infected patients. For HLA class II genes, the biggest difference between the PUUV- and DOBV-infected groups of patients was in HLA-DRB1*13, where this phenotype was more frequent in PUUV-infected patients, especially in the severe form of the disease. HLA-B*07 could play a protective role in PUUV-caused HFRS in the Slovenian population. Our study shows diverse associations of HLA molecules with DOBV- and PUUV-induced HFRS, and therefore, we presume that different hantaviruses are presented differently through the same HLA molecules and that this might lead to either a more severe or a milder form of the disease. In line with this idea, we have noticed that HLA-B*35 might be a genetic risk factor for DOBV infection in the Slovenian population."</span>

Our survey of animal cells found that membrane force foci all have cholesterol-gathering proteins and are reinforced with cholesterol. This result is evident in overt force sensors at the tips of stereocilia for vertebrate hearing and the touch receptor of Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian neurons. For less specialized cells, cadherins sustain the force between neighboring cells and integrins between cells and matrix. These tension bearers also pass through and bind to a cholesterol-enriched platform before anchoring to cytoskeleton through other proteins. Cholesterol, in alliance with sphingomyelin and specialized proteins, enforces a more ordered structure in the bilayer. Such a stiffened platform can suppress mechanical noise, redirect, rescale, and confine force. We speculate that such platforms may be dynamic. The applied force may allow disordered-phase lipids to enter the platform-staging channel opening in the thinner mobile neighborhood. The platform may also contain specialized protein/lipid subdomains enclosing mechanosensitive channels to open with localized tension. Such a dynamic stage can mechanically operate structurally disparate channels or enzymes without having to tie them directly to cadherin, integrin, or other protein tethers."</span>

Not only can transposons inactivate genes by direct disruption and shuffle the genome through recombination, they can also alter gene expression subtly or powerfully. Currently active transposons are highly polymorphic in host populations, including, among hundreds of others, L1 and Alu elements in humans and Ty1 elements in yeast. For this reason, we wished to develop a simple genome-wide method for identifying all transposons in any given sample. We have designed a transposon insertion site profiling chip (TIP-chip), a microarray intended for use as a high-throughput technique for mapping transposon insertions. By selectively amplifying transposon flanking regions and hybridizing them to the array, we can locate all transposons present in a sample. We have tested the TIP-chip extensively to map Ty1 retrotransposon insertions in yeast and have achieved excellent results in two laboratory strains as well as in evolved Ty1 high-copy strains. We are able to identify all of the theoretically detectable transposons in the FY2 lab strain, with essentially no false positives.

OT-I cells accumulated in the draining lymph nodes (LN) of the kidneys and pancreas and in no other LN. They displayed an activated phenotype and a proportion entered cell cycle. Unilateral nephrectomy 7-13 d before inoculation of OT-I cells into RIP-mOVA mice allowed the injected T cells to home only to the regional LN of the remaining kidney (and pancreas), but when the operation was performed 4 h before injecting the T cells, homing to the LN of the excised kidney was evident. When the bone marrow of RIP-mOVA mice was replaced with one of a major histocompatibility haplotype incapable of presenting OVA to OT-I cells, no homing or activation was detectable. Therefore, OT-I cells were activated by OVA presented by short-lived antigen-presenting cells of bone marrow origin present in the draining LN of OVA-expressing tissue. These results provide the first evidence that tissue-associated "self" antigens can be presented in the context of class I via an exogenous processing pathway.

Small numbers of admixed immune spleen cells produced a statistically significant, and reproducible, acceleration of tumor growth in the inoculum as compared with controls of either nonimmune spleen cells or spleen cells from animals immune to a different, noncross-reacting, tumor. Larger numbers of specifically immune spleen cells, however, produced inhibition of tumor growth.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort 1–4 , the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined 5 , but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences 6,7 . Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’ 8 —has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years 9 . Despite recent progress 10–14 , existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14) 15 , demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"High glucose concentrations have a dual effect on β-cell turnover, inducing proliferation in the short-term and apoptosis in the long-term. Hyperglycemia leads to β-cell production of interleuking (IL)-1β in human pancreatic islets. Fas, a death receptor regulated by IL-1β, is involved in glucose-induced β-cell apoptosis. Fas engagement can be switched from death signal to induction of proliferation when the caspase 8 inhibitor, FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP), is active. Here, we show that IL-1β at low concentrations may participate in the mitogenic actions of glucose through the Fas-FLIP pathway. Thus, exposure of human islets to low IL-1β concentrations (0.01–0.02 ng/ml) stimulated proliferation and decreased apoptosis, whereas increasing amounts of IL-1β (2–5 ng/ml) had the reverse effects. A similarly bimodal induction of FLIP, pancreatic duodenal homeobox (PDX)-1, and Pax4 mRNA expression, as well as glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, was observed. In contrast, Fas induction by IL-1β was monophasic. Low IL-1β also induced the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), suppression of which by RNA interference abrogated the beneficial effects of low IL-1β. The Fas antagonistic antibody ZB4 and small interfering RNA to FLIP prevented low IL-1β–stimulated β-cell proliferation. Consistent with our in vitro results, IL-1β knockout mice displayed glucose intolerance along with a decrease in islet Fas, FLIP, Pax4, and PDX-1 transcripts. These findings indicate that low IL-1β levels positively influence β-cell function and turnover through the Fas-FLIP pathway and that IL-1Ra production prevents harmful effects of high IL-1β concentrations."</span>

The potential of the serotonin metabolite 5‐hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5‐HIAA) in the CSF to predict suicide risk within the first year after attempted suicide was studied by means of survival analysis after median split sub‐grouping. Eleven patients (12%) committed suicide within 1 year after attempted suicide.

We analyzed gene expression profiles from the bone marrow of patients from a phase 2 study of the FTI tipifarnib in older adults with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The RASGRP1/APTX gene expression ratio was found to predict response to tipifarnib with the greatest accuracy using a “leave one out” cross validation (LOOCV; 96%). RASGRP1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates RAS, while APTX (aprataxin) is involved in DNA excision repair. The utility of this classifier for predicting response to tipifarnib was validated in an independent set of 58 samples from relapsed or refractory AML, with a negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) of 92% and 28%, respectively (odds ratio of 4.4). The classifier also predicted for improved overall survival (154 vs 56 days; P &lt; .001), which was independent of other covariates, including a previously described prognostic gene expression classifier.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Mitochondrial matrix and membrane fractions were generated from liver, brain, heart, and kidney of wild-type and type 1 diabetic Akita mice. Comparative proteomics was performed using label-free proteome expression analysis. Mitochondrial state 3 respirations and ATP synthesis were measured, and mitochondrial morphology was evaluated by electron microscopy. Expression of genes that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, substrate utilization, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) were determined. RESULTS In diabetic mice, fatty acid oxidation (FAO) proteins were less abundant in liver mitochondria, whereas FAO protein content was induced in mitochondria from all other tissues. Kidney mitochondria showed coordinate induction of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, whereas TCA cycle proteins were repressed in cardiac mitochondria. Levels of OXPHOS subunits were coordinately increased in liver mitochondria, whereas mitochondria of other tissues were unaffected. Mitochondrial respiration, ATP synthesis, and morphology were unaffected in liver and kidney mitochondria. In contrast, state 3 respirations, ATP synthesis, and mitochondrial cristae density were decreased in cardiac mitochondria and were accompanied by coordinate repression of OXPHOS and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor (PPAR)-γ coactivator (PGC)-1α transcripts. CONCLUSIONS Type 1 diabetes causes tissue-specific remodeling of the mitochondrial proteome.

Id2 was proposed to regulate NK and LTi lineage specification from multipotent progenitors through suppression of E proteins. We report that NK cell progenitors are not reduced in the bone marrow (BM) of Id2−/− mice, demonstrating that Id2 is not essential for NK lineage specification. Rather, Id2 is required for development of mature (m) NK cells. We define the mechanism by which Id2 functions by showing that a reduction in E protein activity, through deletion of E2A, overcomes the need for Id2 in development of BM mNK cells, LTi cells, and secondary lymphoid tissues. However, mNK cells are not restored in the blood or spleen of Id2−/−E2A−/− mice, suggesting a role for Id2 in suppression of alternative E proteins after maturation. Interestingly, the few splenic mNK cells in Id2−/− and Id2−/−E2A−/− mice have characteristics of thymus-derived NK cells, which develop in the absence of Id2, implying a differential requirement for Id2 in BM and thymic mNK development.

The complex networks arising from signaling processes are traditionally represented as block diagrams. A key step in the evolution toward a more quantitative understanding of signaling is to explicitly specify the kinetics of all chemical reaction steps in a pathway. Technical advances in proteomics and high-throughput protein interaction assays promise a flood of such quantitative data. While annotations, molecular information and pathway connectivity have been compiled in several databases, and there are several proposals for general cell model description languages, there is currently little experience with databases of chemical kinetics and reaction level models of signaling networks. Results: The Database of Quantitative Cellular Signaling is a repository of models of signaling pathways.

In a fraction of treated patients, however, it causes rapid cancer progression called hyperprogressive disease (HPD). With our observation of HPD in ∼10% of anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-treated advanced gastric cancer (GC) patients, we explored how anti–PD-1 mAb caused HPD in these patients and how HPD could be treated and prevented. In the majority of GC patients, tumor-infiltrating FoxP3 high CD45RA − CD4 + T cells [effector Treg (eTreg) cells], which were abundant and highly suppressive in tumors, expressed PD-1 at equivalent levels as tumor-infiltrating CD4 + or CD8 + effector/memory T cells and at much higher levels than circulating eTreg cells. Comparison of GC tissue samples before and after anti–PD-1 mAb therapy revealed that the treatment markedly increased tumor-infiltrating proliferative (Ki67 + ) eTreg cells in HPD patients, contrasting with their reduction in non-HPD patients. Functionally, circulating and tumor-infiltrating PD-1 + eTreg cells were highly activated, showing higher expression of CTLA-4 than PD-1 − eTreg cells. PD-1 blockade significantly enhanced in vitro Treg cell suppressive activity. Similarly, in mice, genetic ablation or antibody-mediated blockade of PD-1 in Treg cells increased their proliferation and suppression of antitumor immune responses. Taken together, PD-1 blockade may facilitate the proliferation of highly suppressive PD-1 + eTreg cells in HPDs, resulting in inhibition of antitumor immunity. The presence of actively proliferating PD-1 + eTreg cells in tumors is therefore a reliable marker for HPD. Depletion of eTreg cells in tumor tissues would be effective in treating and preventing HPD in PD-1 blockade cancer immunotherapy."</span>

We hypothesized that A2AR also protects cancerous tissues by inhibiting incoming antitumor T lymphocytes. Here we confirm this hypothesis by showing that genetic deletion of A2AR in the host resulted in rejection of established immunogenic tumors in ≈60% of A2AR-deficient mice with no rejection observed in control WT mice. The use of antagonists, including caffeine, or targeting the A2 receptors by siRNA pretreatment of T cells improved the inhibition of tumor growth, destruction of metastases, and prevention of neovascularization by antitumor T cells. The data suggest that effects of A2AR are T cell autonomous. The inhibition of antitumor T cells via their A2AR in the adenosine-rich tumor microenvironment may explain the paradoxical coexistence of tumors and antitumor immune cells in some cancer patients (the “Hellstrom paradox”). We propose to target the hypoxia→adenosine→A2AR pathway as a cancer immunotherapy strategy to prevent the inhibition of antitumor T cells in the tumor microenvironment. The same strategy may prevent the premature termination of immune response and improve the vaccine-induced development of antitumor and antiviral T cells. The observations of autoimmunity during melanoma rejection in A2AR-deficient mice suggest that A2AR in T cells is also important in preventing autoimmunity.

If this were the case, the rate of spread would be limited by the viral replication kinetics. Now, Doceul et al. (p. 873 , published online 21 January; see the Perspective by Pickup ) describe a spreading mechanism used by vaccinia virus that is not restricted by viral replication kinetics and that causes a dramatic acceleration of spread. Early after infection, vaccinia virus proteins A33 and A36 are expressed as a complex on the cell surface. This marks the cell as infected and causes superinfecting virions to be repelled by the formation of actin projections beneath the virus particle. Virions are repelled from infected cells repeatedly until an uninfected cell is reached and are thus pushed further away from the origin of infection to accelerate dissemination."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Mediterranean ecosystems support important processes and functions that bring direct benefits to human society. Yet, marine ecosystem services are usually overlooked due to the challenges in identifying and quantifying them. This paper proposes the application of several biophysical and ecosystem modelling approaches to assess spatially and temporally the sustainable use and supply of selected marine ecosystem services. Such services include food provision, water purification, coastal protection, lifecycle maintenance and recreation, focusing on the Mediterranean region. Overall, our study found a higher number of decreasing than increasing trends in the natural capacity of the ecosystems to provide marine and coastal services, while in contrast the opposite was observed to be true for the realised flow of services to humans. Such a study paves the way towards an effective support for Blue Growth and the European maritime policies, although little attention is paid to the quantification of marine ecosystem services in this context. We identify a key challenge of integrating biophysical and socio-economic models as a necessary step to further this research."</span>

We sought to explore local immune checkpoint blockade, with an antibody (Ab) form that would be retained intra- or peritumorally, limiting systemic exposure. To accomplish this, we conjugated the checkpoint blockade Abs to an extracellular matrix (ECM)–super-affinity peptide derived from placenta growth factor–2 (PlGF-2 123–144 ). We show enhanced tissue retention and lower Ab concentrations in blood plasma after PlGF-2 123–144 conjugation, reducing systemic side effects such as the risk of autoimmune diabetes. Peritumoral injections of PlGF-2 123–144 –anti-CTLA4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4) and PlGF-2 123–144 –anti–PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1) Abs delayed tumor growth and prolonged survival compared to the unmodified Abs in genetically engineered murine tumor models of melanoma and breast cancer. The PlGF-2 123–144 –Abs increased tumor-infiltrating activated CD8 + and CD4 + T cells, resulting in a delay of distant tumor growth as well. This simple and translatable approach of engineered ECM-binding Abs may present a viable and safer approach in checkpoint blockade."</span>

Both theory and experiments have suggested that persisters facilitate genetic resistance by constituting an evolutionary reservoir of viable cells. Here, we provide evidence for a strong positive correlation between persistence and the likelihood to become genetically resistant in natural and lab strains of E. coli. This correlation can be partly attributed to the increased availability of viable cells associated with persistence. However, our data additionally show that persistence is pleiotropically linked with mutation rates. Our theoretical model further demonstrates that increased survival and mutation rates jointly affect the likelihood of evolving clinical resistance.

In this study, we further investigate the mechanism by which CatS is induced by radiation and its function. Radiation induced production of CatS at both the mRNA and protein level, and increased its protease activity. In addition, these radiation induced changes occurred in a dose and time‐dependent fashion. Agents such as bleomycin, As 2 O 3 and H 2 O 2 , which produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), also induced CatS expression; however, other agents that damage DNA such as taxol and cisplatin did not. Additionally, treatment of the cells with the ROS scavengers, N‐acetylcysteine and catalase, inhibited the radiation induced CatS expression. Furthermore, radiation‐induced ROS was also involved in IFN‐γ production, which was responsible for radiation‐mediated CatS expression. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) data obtained using an IFN‐stimulated response element (ISRE) oligonucleotide revealed that IFN regulatory factor‐1 (IRF1) was the critical transcriptional mediator of IFN‐γ‐dependent CatS production after radiation. Finally, CatS overespression was found to induce radioresistance; however, knockdown of CatS resulted in the suppression of radioresistance. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that radiation induced CatS expression via ROS‐IFN‐γ pathways, and that this increased expression may be involved in radioresistance. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc."</span>

Methods and results We reviewed the clinical records of all patients with Williams-Beuren syndrome examined between 1981 and 2006. We identified 150 patients, aged from 7 months to 45 years, with a follow-up from 6 months to 25 years, the mean being 6.4 years. A cardiac anomaly was present in 113 of the 150 patients (75%). Defects were typical in over four-fifths of the group. We found supravalvar aortic stenosis in 73 of 113 patients (64.6%), isolated in 43. Pulmonary stenosis, isolated in 18 cases, was found in 51 of 113 (45.1%), while aortic coarctation and mitral valvar prolapse were each found in 7 (6.2%), 3 of the lesions is isolation. Atypical defects were found in 19 patients, tetralogy of Fallot in 2, atrial septal defects in 4, aortic and mitral valvar insufficiencies in 1 each, bicuspid aortic valves in 2, and ventricular septal defects in 9, 4 of the last being isolated. Systemic hypertension, observed in 33 patients (22%), was poorly controlled in 10. Diagnostic and/or interventional cardiac catheterization was undertaken in 24 patients, with 30 surgical procedures performed in 26 patients. Of the group, 3 patients died. Conclusion Cardiac defects were present in three-quarters of our patients. Pulmonary arterial lesions generally improved, while supravalvar aortic stenosis often progressed.

One consequence may be a large reduction of the Earth's biodiversity, potentially representing a sixth mass extinction. With effective stewardship, the global change drivers that threaten the Earth's biota could be alleviated, but this requires clear understanding of the drivers, their interactions, and how they impact ecological communities. This review identifies 10 anthropogenic global change drivers and discusses how six of the drivers (atmospheric CO 2 enrichment, climate change, land transformation, species exploitation, exotic species invasions, eutrophication) impact Earth's biodiversity. Driver impacts on a particular species could be positive or negative. In either case, they initiate secondary responses that cascade along ecological lines of connection and in doing so magnify the initial impact. The unique nature of the threat to the Earth's biodiversity is not simply due to the magnitude of each driver, but due to the speed of change, the novelty of the drivers, and their interactions. Emphasizing one driver, notably climate change, is problematic because the other global change drivers also degrade biodiversity and together threaten the stability of the biosphere. As the main academic journal addressing global change effects on living systems, GCB is well positioned to provide leadership in solving the global change challenge. If humanity cannot meet the challenge, then GCB is positioned to serve as a leading chronicle of the sixth mass extinction to occur on planet Earth."</span>

Four types of ion‐conducting, inorganic solid electrolytes are tested: Amorphous 70/30 mol% Li 2 S‐P 2 S 5 , polycrystalline β‐Li 3 PS 4 , and polycrystalline and single‐crystalline Li 6 La 3 ZrTaO 12 garnet. The nature of lithium plating depends on the proximity of the current collector to defects such as surface cracks and on the current density. Lithium plating penetrates/infiltrates at defects, but only above a critical current density. Eventually, infiltration results in a short circuit between the current collector and the Li‐source (anode). These results do not depend on the electrolytes shear modulus and are thus not consistent with the Monroe–Newman model for “dendrites.” The observations suggest that Li‐plating in pre‐existing flaws produces crack‐tip stresses which drive crack propagation, and an electrochemomechanical model of plating‐induced Li infiltration is proposed. Lithium short‐circuits through solid electrolytes occurs through a fundamentally different process than through liquid electrolytes. The onset of Li infiltration depends on solid‐state electrolyte surface morphology, in particular the defect size and density."</span>

Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) activates macrophages by driving Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription–dependent induction of transcription and PKR-dependent suppression of translation. Microarray-based experiments reported here enlarge this picture. Exposure to IFN-γ and/or Mtb led to altered expression of 25% of the monitored genome in macrophages. The number of genes suppressed by IFN-γ exceeded the number of genes induced, and much of the suppression was transcriptional. Five times as many genes related to immunity and inflammation were induced than suppressed. Mtb mimicked or synergized with IFN-γ more than antagonized its actions. Phagocytosis of nonviable Mtb or polystyrene beads affected many genes, but the transcriptional signature of macrophages infected with viable Mtb was distinct.

If resulting uracils are not replaced with cytosine, C to T mutations occur. These facts suggest that cellular processes such as transcription that create single-stranded DNA should promote C to T mutations. We tested this hypothesis with the Escherichia coli tac promoter and found that induction of transcription causes ≈4-fold increase in the frequency of C to U or 5-methylcytosine to T deaminations in the nontranscribed strand. Excess mutations caused by C to U deaminations were reduced, but not eliminated, by uracil-DNA glycosylase. Similarly, mutations caused by 5-methylcytosine to T deaminations were only partially reduced by the very short-patch repair process in E. coli . These effects are unlikely to be caused by differential repair of the two strands, and our results suggest that all actively transcribed genes in E. coli should acquire more C to T mutations in the nontranscribed strand."</span>

Climate models project runoff losses of 7–20% from the basin in this century due to human-induced climate change. Recent work has shown however that by the late 1800s, decades prior to allocation of the river’s runoff in the 1920s, a fivefold increase in dust loading from anthropogenically disturbed soils in the southwest United States was already decreasing snow albedo and shortening the duration of snow cover by several weeks. The degree to which this increase in radiative forcing by dust in snow has affected timing and magnitude of runoff from the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) is unknown. Here we use the Variable Infiltration Capacity model with postdisturbance and predisturbance impacts of dust on albedo to estimate the impact on runoff from the UCRB across 1916–2003. We find that peak runoff at Lees Ferry, Arizona has occurred on average 3 wk earlier under heavier dust loading and that increases in evapotranspiration from earlier exposure of vegetation and soils decreases annual runoff by more than 1.0 billion cubic meters or ∼5% of the annual average. The potential to reduce dust loading through surface stabilization in the deserts and restore more persistent snow cover, slow runoff, and increase water resources in the UCRB may represent an important mitigation opportunity to reduce system management tensions and regional impacts of climate change."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Two distinctly different organelles of locomotion are produced by Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The polar flagellum is responsible for motility in a liquid environment (swimming), and the lateral flagella enable the bacteria to move over surfaces (swarming). Synthesis of lateral flagella occurs when V. parahaemolyticus is grown on agar media but not when it is grown in liquid media. We used lux (luminescence gene) fusions to conveniently and sensitively analyze the factors which influence transcription of lateral flagella genes (laf). Transposon mini-Mu lux was used to mutagenize V. parahaemolyticus and to generate laf::lux transcriptional fusions. Mutants with insertions of mini-Mu lux in laf genes were defective in the swarming phenotype and produced light when the bacteria were propagated on agar media, but not when cells were grown in liquid media. Thus, surface-dependent expression of lateral flagella synthesis is controlled by regulation of transcription. Such fusion strains were also used to further define the environmental conditions which induce laf gene expression. Cultivation on media solidified by gelling agents other than agar also induced light production in fusion strains, as did growth on a variety of hydrophilic membrane filters suspended over liquid media. Growth at an air-surface interface was not necessary for expression since embedding the fusion strains in agar was also effective. Furthermore, induction of laf gene transcription could also be accomplished by increasing the viscosity of the liquid medium by the addition of a high-molecular-weight polymer such as polyvinylpyrrolidone. Increase in luminescence of the fusion strains was detected within 30 min of initiation of the inducing circumstance, and reversal of induction, e.g., by dilution of the viscous medium, resulted in a rapid decline in the rate of increase in luminescence. Conditions that induced luminescence in the fusion strains also induced the synthesis of lateral flagella in wild-type V. parahaemolyticus.

These nexuses are intriguing because of their potential role in integration and also because they may augment metabolic cascades relevant to brain disease. To identify regions of high connectivity in the human cerebral cortex, we applied a computationally efficient approach to map the degree of intrinsic functional connectivity across the brain. Analysis of two separate functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets (each n = 24) demonstrated hubs throughout heteromodal areas of association cortex. Prominent hubs were located within posterior cingulate, lateral temporal, lateral parietal, and medial/lateral prefrontal cortices. Network analysis revealed that many, but not all, hubs were located within regions previously implicated as components of the default network. A third dataset ( n = 12) demonstrated that the locations of hubs were present across passive and active task states, suggesting that they reflect a stable property of cortical network architecture. To obtain an accurate reference map, data were combined across 127 participants to yield a consensus estimate of cortical hubs. Using this consensus estimate, we explored whether the topography of hubs could explain the pattern of vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease (AD) because some models suggest that regions of high activity and metabolism accelerate pathology. Positron emission tomography amyloid imaging in AD ( n = 10) compared with older controls ( n = 29) showed high amyloid-β deposition in the locations of cortical hubs consistent with the possibility that hubs, while acting as critical way stations for information processing, may also augment the underlying pathological cascade in AD."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Immunoresponsive gene 1 ( Irg1 ) is highly expressed in mammalian macrophages during inflammation, but its biological function has not yet been elucidated. Here, we identify Irg1 as the gene coding for an enzyme producing itaconic acid (also known as methylenesuccinic acid) through the decarboxylation of cis -aconitate, a tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate. Using a gain-and-loss-of-function approach in both mouse and human immune cells, we found Irg1 expression levels correlating with the amounts of itaconic acid, a metabolite previously proposed to have an antimicrobial effect. We purified IRG1 protein and identified its cis -aconitate decarboxylating activity in an enzymatic assay. Itaconic acid is an organic compound that inhibits isocitrate lyase, the key enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt, a pathway essential for bacterial growth under specific conditions. Here we show that itaconic acid inhibits the growth of bacteria expressing isocitrate lyase, such as Salmonella enterica and Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Furthermore, Irg1 gene silencing in macrophages resulted in significantly decreased intracellular itaconic acid levels as well as significantly reduced antimicrobial activity during bacterial infections. Taken together, our results demonstrate that IRG1 links cellular metabolism with immune defense by catalyzing itaconic acid production."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Nonsyndromic cleft lip ± cleft palate is a complex disease with a wide phenotypic spectrum; occult defects of the superior orbicularis oris muscle may represent the mildest subclinical form of the lip portion of the phenotype. This study used high‐resolution ultrasonography to compare the frequency of discontinuities in the OO muscle in 525 unaffected relatives of individuals with nonsyndromic cleft lip ± cleft palate versus 257 unaffected controls. OO muscle discontinuities were observed in 54 (10.3%) of the non‐cleft relatives, compared to 15 (5.8%) of the controls—a statistically significant increase ( P = 0.04). Male relatives had a significantly higher rate of discontinuities than male controls (12.0% vs. 3.2%; P = 0.01); female relatives also had a higher rate of discontinuities than female controls, but the increase was not statistically significant (8.9% vs. 7.4%; P = 0.56). These data confirm the hypothesis that subepithelial OO muscle defects are a mild manifestation of the cleft lip phenotype. Identification of subepithelial OO muscle defects may be important in a clinical setting, as a means of providing more accurate recurrence risk estimates to relatives in cleft families. Furthermore, the expansion of the cleft lip ± cleft palate phenotypic spectrum should improve the power of genetic studies. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Both paramutation and Mutator ( Mu ) transposon inactivation involve heritable changes in gene expression without concomitant changes in DNA sequence. The mechanisms by which these shifts in gene activity are achieved are unknown. Here we present evidence that these two phenomena are linked mechanistically. We show that mutation of a gene, modifier of paramutation 1 ( mop1 ), which prevents paramutation at three different loci in maize, can reverse methylation of Mutator elements reliably. In mop1 mutant backgrounds, methylation of nonautonomous Mu elements can be reversed even in the absence of the regulatory MuDR element. Previously silenced MuDR elements are reactivated sporadically after multiple generations of exposure to mop1 mutations. MuDR methylation is separable from MuDR silencing, because removal of methylation does not cause immediate reactivation. The mop1 mutation does not alter the methylation of certain other transposable elements including those just upstream of a paramutable b1 gene. Our results suggest that the mop1 gene acts on a subset of epigenetically regulated sequences in the maize genome and paramutation and Mu element methylation require a common factor, which we hypothesize influences chromatin structure."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Recent population studies have identified important interrelationships between sleep duration and body weight regulation. The hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin neuropeptide system is able to influence each of these. Disruption of the hypocretin system, such as occurs in narcolepsy, leads to a disruption of sleep and is often associated with increased body mass index. We examined the potential interrelationship between the hypocretin system, metabolism and sleep by measuring locomotion, feeding, drinking, body temperature, sleep/wake and energy metabolism in a mouse model of narcolepsy (ataxin‐ablation of hypocretin‐expressing neurons). We found that locomotion, feeding, drinking and energy expenditure were significantly reduced in the narcoleptic mice. These mice also exhibited severe sleep/wake fragmentation. Upon awakening, transgenic and control mice displayed a similar rate of increase in locomotion and food/water intake with time. A lack of long wake episodes partially or entirely explains observed differences in overall locomotion, feeding and drinking in these transgenic mice. Like other parameters, energy expenditure also rose and fell depending on the sleep/wake status. Unlike other parameters, however, energy expenditure in control mice increased upon awakening at a greater rate than in the narcoleptic mice. We conclude that the profound sleep/wake fragmentation is a leading cause of the reduced locomotion, feeding, drinking and energy expenditure in the narcoleptic mice under unperturbed conditions. We also identify an intrinsic role of the hypocretin system in energy expenditure that may not be dependent on sleep/wake regulation, locomotion, or food intake. This investigation illustrates the need for coordinated study of multiple phenotypes in mouse models with altered sleep/wake patterns."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Macroautophagy (autophagy) is a regulated catabolic pathway to degrade cellular organelles and macromolecules. The role of autophagy in cancer is complex and may differ depending on tumor type or context. Here we show that pancreatic cancers have a distinct dependence on autophagy. Pancreatic cancer primary tumors and cell lines show elevated autophagy under basal conditions. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy leads to increased reactive oxygen species, elevated DNA damage, and a metabolic defect leading to decreased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Together, these ultimately result in significant growth suppression of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Most importantly, inhibition of autophagy by genetic means or chloroquine treatment leads to robust tumor regression and prolonged survival in pancreatic cancer xenografts and genetic mouse models. These results suggest that, unlike in other cancers where autophagy inhibition may synergize with chemotherapy or targeted agents by preventing the up-regulation of autophagy as a reactive survival mechanism, autophagy is actually required for tumorigenic growth of pancreatic cancers de novo, and drugs that inactivate this process may have a unique clinical utility in treating pancreatic cancers and other malignancies with a similar dependence on autophagy. As chloroquine and its derivatives are potent inhibitors of autophagy and have been used safely in human patients for decades for a variety of purposes, these results are immediately translatable to the treatment of pancreatic cancer patients, and provide a much needed, novel vantage point of attack."</span>

However, the normal functions of the synucleins are still unknown. For this reason, we characterized α-, β-, and γ-synuclein expression in primary hippocampal neuronal cultures and showed that the onset of α- and β-synuclein expression was delayed after synaptic development, suggesting that these synucleins may not be essential for synapse formation. In mature cultured primary neurons, α- and β-synuclein colocalized almost exclusively with synaptophysin in the presynaptic terminal, whereas little γ-synuclein was expressed at all. To assess the function of α-synuclein, we suppressed expression of this protein with antisense oligonucleotide technology. Morphometric ultrastructural analysis of the α-synuclein antisense oligonucleotide-treated cultures revealed a significant reduction in the distal pool of synaptic vesicles. These data suggest that one function of α-synuclein may be to regulate the size of distinct pools of synaptic vesicles in mature neurons."</span>

Upon activation by diacylglycerol, PKC translocates to different subcellular sites where it phosphorylates numerous proteins, most of which are unidentified. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with activated PKC alpha. Using the catalytic region of PKC fused to the DNA binding domain of yeast GAL4 as "bait" to screen a mouse T cell cDNA library in which cDNA was fused to the GAL4 activation domain, we cloned several novel proteins that interact with C-kinase (PICKs). One of these proteins, designated PICK1, interacts specifically with the catalytic domain of PKC and is an efficient substrate for phosphorylation by PKC in vitro and in vivo. PICK1 is localized to the perinuclear region and is phosphorylated in response to PKC activation. PICK1 and other PICKs may play important roles in mediating the actions of PKC."</span>

In contrast, we report that during early development, synaptic release of GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mature brain, is not only excitatory but in addition plays a more robust role than glutamate in generating spike activity in mouse hypothalamic neurons. Based on gramicidin perforated whole cell and extracellular recording, which leave intracellular Cl − unperturbed in brain slices and cultures, the GABA A receptor antagonist bicuculline induced a dramatic decrease in spike frequency (83% decrease) in developing neurons, three times greater than that generated by glutamate receptor antagonists 2-amino-5-phosphono-pentanoic acid and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxalene-2,3-dione.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Natural killer T (NKT) cells are important regulators of the immune system, but their trafficking machinery, including expression of chemokine receptors, has been poorly defined. Unlike other conventional T-cell populations, we show that most NKT cells express receptors for extralymphoid tissue or inflammation-related chemokines (CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR3), while few NKT cells express lymphoid tissue–homing chemokine receptors (CCR7 and CXCR5). A population with homing potential for lymph nodes (L selectin+ CCR7+) exists only within a small subset of CD4 NKT cells. We show differential expression of chemokine receptors among NKT cell subsets: CCR4 is mainly expressed by a high cytokine (interleukin-4/interleukin-2)–producing (CD4) NKT subset, while CCR1, CCR6, and CXCR6 are preferentially expressed by the low cytokine-producing CD8 and CD4−CD8− subsets. In line with this, TARC/CCL17 (a CCR4 ligand) induces preferential chemotaxis of the CD4 NKT subset, while chemotactic activities of LARC/CCL20 (a CCR6 ligand) and MIP-1α/CCL3 (a CCR1 ligand) are focused on the CD8 and CD4−CD8− NKT cells. We conclude that, unlike conventional naive, memory, or effector T cells, the entire NKT cell population expresses nonlymphoid tissue homing chemokine receptors, yet NKT cell subsets differ considerably from each other by displaying distinct and reciprocal expression patterns of some chemokine receptors. Our results identify chemokine receptors that are potentially important for trafficking of human blood NKT cell subsets and reveal their function (cytokine production capacity)–dependent differential trafficking potentials."</span>

We purified M-T7 to apparent homogeneity and showed that M-T7 is an N-linked glycoprotein that appears to be a stable homotrimer with a molecular mass of approximately 113 kDa in solution. M-T7, in addition to forming inhibitory complexes with rabbit gamma interferon, was also shown to bind to human interleukin-8, a prototypic member of the chemokine superfamily. Moreover, M-T7 was able to interact promiscuously with all members of the CXC, CC, and C chemokine subfamilies tested. Binding of human RANTES to M-T7 can be competed by rabbit gamma interferon and also by cold RANTES competitor with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 900 nM. Although M-T7 retains binding to a number of interleukin-8 N-terminal (ELR) deletion mutants, binding to mutants containing deletions in the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of interleukin-8 is abrogated. Furthermore, heparin effectively competes the interaction of M-T7 with the chemokine RANTES but not with rabbit gamma interferon. We propose that this novel M-T7 interaction with members of the chemokine superfamily may be facilitated through the conserved heparin-binding domains found in a wide spectrum of chemokines and that M-T7 may function by modulating chemokine-glycosaminoglycan interactions in virus-infected tissues."</span>

In vitro studies indicate that blockage of Kv1.3 inhibits T cell activation, suggesting that Kv1.3 may be a target for immunosuppression. However, despite the in vitro evidence, there has been no in vivo demonstration that blockade of Kv1.3 will attenuate an immune response. The difficulty is due to species differences, as the channel does not set the membrane potential in rodent peripheral T cells. In this study, we show that the channel is present on peripheral T cells of miniswine. Using the peptidyl Kv1.3 inhibitor, margatoxin, we demonstrate that Kv1.3 also regulates the resting membrane potential, and that blockade of Kv1.3 inhibits, in vivo, both a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction and an Ab response to an allogeneic challenge. In addition, prolonged Kv1.3 blockade causes reduced thymic cellularity and inhibits the thymic development of T cell subsets. These results provide in vivo evidence that Kv1.3 is a novel target for immunomodulation."</span>

To investigate the mechanisms that control translation during early development, we have focused on an mRNA, termed G10, that is recruited for translation during oocyte maturation. Coincident with its translation, the poly(A) tail of this message is elongated from approximately 90 to 200 adenylate residues. To identify the cis sequence that is required for this cytoplasmic adenylation and recruitment, we have synthesized wild-type and deletion mutant G10 mRNAs with SP6 polymerase. When injected into oocytes that subsequently were induced to mature with progesterone, wild-type G10 mRNA, but not mutant transcripts lacking a 50-base sequence in the 3'-untranslated region, was polyadenylated and recruited for translation. The 50-base sequence was sufficient to confer polyadenylation and translation when fused to globin mRNA, which does not normally undergo these processes during oocyte maturation. Further mutational analysis of this region revealed that a U-rich sequence 5' to the AAUAAA hexanucleotide nuclear polyadenylation signal, as well as the hexanucleotide itself, were both required for polyadenylation and translation. The 50-base cis element directs polyadenylation, but not translation per se, as a transcript that terminates with 3'-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin) is not recruited for translation. The available data suggest that the dynamic process of polyadenylation, and not the length of the poly(A) tail, is required for translational recruitment during oocyte maturation."</span>

The deletion of LKB1 in the liver of adult mice resulted in a nearly complete loss of AMPK activity. Loss of LKB1 function resulted in hyperglycemia with increased gluconeogenic and lipogenic gene expression. In LKB1-deficient livers, TORC2, a transcriptional coactivator of CREB (cAMP response element–binding protein), was dephosphorylated and entered the nucleus, driving the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), which in turn drives gluconeogenesis. Adenoviral small hairpin RNA (shRNA) for TORC2 reduced PGC-1α expression and normalized blood glucose levels in mice with deleted liver LKB1, indicating that TORC2 is a critical target of LKB1/AMPK signals in the regulation of gluconeogenesis.

Methods Daily number of deaths in all residential and nursing homes in England notified to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) from 1 January 2017 to 7 August 2020. Care home-level data linked with CQC care home register to identify home characteristics: client type (over 65s/children and adults), ownership status (for-profit/not-for-profit; branded/independent) and size (small/medium/large). Excess deaths computed as the difference between observed and predicted deaths using local authority fixed-effect Poisson regressions on pre-pandemic data. Fixed-effect logistic regressions were used to model odds of experiencing COVID-19 suspected/confirmed deaths. Results Up to 7 August 2020, there were 29,542 (95% CI 25,176 to 33,908) excess deaths in all care homes. Excess deaths represented 6.5% (95% CI 5.5 to 7.4%) of all care home beds, higher in nursing (8.4%) than residential (4.6%) homes. 64.7% (95% CI 56.4 to 76.0%) of the excess deaths were confirmed/suspected COVID-19. Almost all excess deaths were recorded in the quarter (27.4%) of homes with any COVID-19 fatalities. The odds of experiencing COVID-19 attributable deaths were higher in homes providing nursing services (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.0), to older people and/or with dementia (OR 5.5, 95% CI 4.4 to 6.8), amongst larger (vs. small) homes (OR 13.3, 95% CI 11.5 to 15.4) and belonging to a large provider/brand (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3). There was no significant association with for-profit status of providers. Conclusions To limit excess mortality, policy should be targeted at care homes to minimise the risk of ingress of disease and limit subsequent transmission. Our findings provide specific characteristic targets for further research on mechanisms and policy priority."</span>

We hypothesized that exchange of proteins associated with their cytoplasmic domains may play a role in coordinating function. To test this idea, we used Trojan peptides to introduce into cells and tissues peptide sequences designed to compete for the interaction of specific effectors with the cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin, and assayed their effect on cadherin- and integrin-mediated adhesion and neurite outgrowth. We show that a peptide mimicking the juxtamembrane (JMP) region of the cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin results in inhibition of N-cadherin and β1-integrin function. The effect of JMP on β1-integrin function depends on the expression of N-cadherin and is independent of transcription or translation. Treatment of cells with JMP results in the release of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Fer from the cadherin complex and its accumulation in the integrin complex. A peptide that mimics the first coiled-coil domain of Fer prevents Fer accumulation in the integrin complex and reverses the inhibitory effect of JMP. These findings suggest a new mechanism through which N-cadherin and β1-integrins are coordinately regulated: loss of an effector from the cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin and gain of that effector by the β1-integrin complex."</span>

Using electron microscopy we have characterized spacer transcription in such an individual and have confirmed that the sites of transcription initiation correspond to the imperfectly duplicated promoters ("Bam islands") present in the X. laevis rDNA spacer. We have cloned a repeat unit containing a gene and a spacer from this individual and have injected the recombinant plasmid, pXlr 164, into oocytes of other X. laevis individuals. In electron microscope preparations the spacers of some of the cloned repeats were transcribed by RNA polymerase I. This demonstrates that the ability to initiate transcription at the Bam islands is a property of the spacer DNA. On pXlr 164, initiation in the spacer occurred about 5% as frequently as transcription from the gene promoter. However, transcribed spacers were as closely packed with RNA polymerase as was the gene. We conclude that polymerase I promoters may vary over a wide range in the frequency with which they "activate" but that once activated all can load polymerases to maximal density. The presence or absence of spacer transcription had no observable effect on either the frequency of activation or the density of polymerase loading of the gene immediately downstream. A subclone, pXlr 264, containing only spacer DNA also showed regular initiation and termination, providing further evidence that there is an effective "fail-safe" termination signal 225 base pairs upstream from the rRNA gene initiation site."</span>

Mitotic phosphorylation sites were mapped by mass spec sequencing of recombinant Aur-A protein that had been activated by incubation in extracts of metaphase-arrested Xenopus eggs. Three sites were identified: serine 53 (Ser-53), threonine 295 (Thr-295), and serine 349 (Ser-349), which are equivalent to Ser-51, Thr-288, and Ser-342, respectively, in human Aur-A. To ask how phosphorylation of these residues might affect kinase activity, each was mutated to either alanine or aspartic acid, and the recombinant proteins were then tested for their ability to be activated by M phase extract. Mutation of Thr-295, which resides in the activation loop of the kinase, to either alanine or aspartic acid abolished activity. The S349A mutant had slightly reduced activity, indicating that phosphorylation is not required for activity.

We previously found lazabemide to be safe and well tolerated at dosages of up to 400 mg/day during a 6‐week study of 201 patients with early untereated Parkinson's disease (PD). We now assess whether or not lazabemide influences the progression of disability in untreated PD. Patients (N = 321) were assigned by randomization to one of five treatment groups (placebo, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg/day) and followed systematically for up to 1 year. The risk of reaching the primary end point (the onset of disability sufficient to require levodopa therapy) was reduced by 51% for the patients who received lazabemide compared with placebo‐treated subjects. This effect was consistent among all dosages. The frequency of adverse experiences did not placebo‐treated subjects. This effect was consistent among all dosages. The frequency of adverse experiences did not differ among the treatment groups. At dosages ranging from 25 to 200 mg/day, lazabemide was well tolerated and delayed the need for levodopa in early, otherwise untreated PD. The magnitude and pattern of benefits were similar to those observed after 1 year of deprenyl (selegiline) treatment in the DATATOP clinical trial."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"During the clonal expansion of cancer from an ancestral cell with an initiating oncogenic mutation to symptomatic neoplasm, the occurrence of somatic mutations (both driver and passenger) can be used to track the on-going evolution of the neoplasm. All subclones within a cancer are phylogenetically related, with the prevalence of each subclone determined by its evolutionary fitness and the timing of its origin relative to other subclones. Recently developed massively parallel sequencing platforms promise the ability to detect rare subclones of genetic variants without a priori knowledge of the mutations involved. We used ultra-deep pyrosequencing to investigate intraclonal diversification at the Ig heavy chain locus in 22 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Analysis of a non-polymorphic control locus revealed artifactual insertions and deletions resulting from sequencing errors and base substitutions caused by polymerase misincorporation during PCR amplification. We developed an algorithm to differentiate genuine haplotypes of somatic hypermutations from such artifacts. This proved capable of detecting multiple rare subclones with frequencies as low as 1 in 5000 copies and allowed the characterization of phylogenetic interrelationships among subclones within each patient. This study demonstrates the potential for ultra-deep resequencing to recapitulate the dynamics of clonal evolution in cancer cell populations."</span>

This study evaluated the inhibitory activity of nisin in combination with a chelating agent, disodium EDTA, against several Salmonella species and other selected gram-negative bacteria. After a 1-h exposure to 50 micrograms of nisin per ml and 20 mM disodium EDTA at 37 degrees C, a 3.2- to 6.9-log-cycle reduction in population was observed with the species tested. Treatment with disodium EDTA or nisin alone produced no significant inhibition (less than 1-log-cycle reduction) of the Salmonella and other gram-negative species tested. These results demonstrated that nisin is bactericidal to Salmonella species and that the observed inactivation can be demonstrated in other gram-negative bacteria.

To investigate neurophysiological mechanisms of such top-down effects, we analyzed the temporal interactions of neurons on different levels of the cortical hierarchy during perception of stimuli with varying behavioral significance. We found that interareal interactions in a middle-frequency range (θ and α; 4–12 Hz) strongly depend on the associated behavior, with a phase relationship and a layer specificity indicating a top-down-directed interaction. For novel unexpected stimuli, presumably processed in a feed-forward fashion, no such interactions occurred but high-frequency interactions (γ; 20–100 Hz) were observed.

X-linked acrogigantism (XLAG) syndrome is a recently characterized genomic form of pediatric gigantism due to aggressive pituitary tumors that is caused by submicroscopic chromosome Xq26.3 duplications that include GPR101 . We studied XLAG syndrome patients ( n = 18) to determine if somatic mosaicism contributed to the genomic pathophysiology. Eighteen subjects with XLAG syndrome caused by Xq26.3 duplications were identified using high-definition array comparative genomic hybridization (HD-aCGH). We noted that males with XLAG had a decreased log 2 ratio (LR) compared with expected values, suggesting potential mosaicism, whereas females showed no such decrease. Compared with familial male XLAG cases, sporadic males had more marked evidence for mosaicism, with levels of Xq26.3 duplication between 16.1 and 53.8%. These characteristics were replicated using a novel, personalized breakpoint junction-specific quantification droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) technique. Using a separate ddPCR technique, we studied the feasibility of identifying XLAG syndrome cases in a distinct patient population of 64 unrelated subjects with acromegaly/gigantism, and identified one female gigantism patient who had had increased copy number variation (CNV) threshold for GPR101 that was subsequently diagnosed as having XLAG syndrome on HD-aCGH. Employing a combination of HD-aCGH and novel ddPCR approaches, we have demonstrated, for the first time, that XLAG syndrome can be caused by variable degrees of somatic mosaicism for duplications at chromosome Xq26.3. Somatic mosaicism was shown to occur in sporadic males but not in females with XLAG syndrome, although the clinical characteristics of the disease were similarly severe in both sexes."</span>

Compelling evidence exists that molecular motors of the dynein and kinesin families are involved in the tubulation of organelles. Here, we show that lipid giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), to which kinesin molecules have been attached by means of small polystyrene beads, give rise to membrane tubes and to complex tubular networks when incubated in vitro with microtubules and ATP. Similar tubes and networks are obtained with GUVs made of purified Golgi lipids, as well as with Golgi membranes. No tube formation was observed when kinesins were directly bound to the GUV membrane, suggesting that it is critical to distribute the load on both lipids and motors by means of beads. A kinetic analysis shows that network growth occurs in two phases: a phase in which membrane-bound beads move at the same velocity than free beads, followed by a phase in which the tube growth rate decreases and strongly fluctuates. Our work demonstrates that the action of motors bound to a lipid bilayer is sufficient to generate membrane tubes and opens the way to well controlled experiments aimed at the understanding of basic mechanisms in intracellular transport."</span>

The sharing of EHRs by the National Health Insurance Sharing Service (NHISS) of Korea has made it possible to analyze Koreans’ medical data which include treatments, prescriptions, and medical check-up. After considering the merits and effectiveness of such data, we analyzed patients’ medical information and recommended optimal pharmaceutical prescriptions for diabetes, which is known to be the most burdensome disease for Koreans. We also proposed an MDP-based treatment recommendation system for diabetic patients to help doctors when prescribing diabetes medications. To build the model, we used the 11-year Korean NHISS database.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"ABSTRACT Recent results have shown that the ability of farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) to inhibit malignant cell transformation and Ras prenylation can be separated. We proposed previously that farnesylated Rho proteins are important targets for alternation by FTIs, based on studies of RhoB (the FTI-Rho hypothesis). Cells treated with FTIs exhibit a loss of farnesylated RhoB but a gain of geranylgeranylated RhoB (RhoB-GG), which is associated with loss of growth-promoting activity. In this study, we tested whether the gain of RhoB-GG elicited by FTI treatment was sufficient to mediate FTI-induced cell growth inhibition. In support of this hypothesis, when expressed in Ras-transformed cells RhoB-GG induced phenotypic reversion, cell growth inhibition, and activation of the cell cycle kinase inhibitor p21WAF1. RhoB-GG did not affect the phenotype or growth of normal cells. These effects were similar to FTI treatment insofar as they were all induced in transformed cells but not in normal cells. RhoB-GG did not promote anoikis of Ras-transformed cells, implying that this response to FTIs involves loss-of-function effects. Our findings corroborate the FTI-Rho hypothesis and demonstrate that gain-of-function effects on Rho are part of the drug mechanism. Gain of RhoB-GG may explain how FTIs inhibit the growth of human tumor cells that lack Ras mutations."</span>

Because null KIF5A mutants die immediately after birth, a synapsin-promoted Cre-recombinase transgene was used to direct inactivation of KIF5A in neurons postnatally. Three fourths of such mutant mice exhibited seizures and death at around 3 wk of age; the remaining animals survived to 3 mo or longer. In young mutant animals, fast axonal transport appeared to be intact, but NF-H, as well as NF-M and NF-L, accumulated in the cell bodies of peripheral sensory neurons accompanied by a reduction in sensory axon caliber. Older animals also developed age-dependent sensory neuron degeneration, an accumulation of NF subunits in cell bodies and a reduction in axons, loss of large caliber axons, and hind limb paralysis.

Conventional wisdom is that vestibular information is exclusively transmitted through changes in firing rate, yet under this assumption vestibular neurons display relatively poor detection and information transmission. Here, we carry out an analysis of the system’s coding capabilities by recording neuronal responses to repeated presentations of naturalistic stimuli. We find that afferents with greater intrinsic variability reliably discriminate between different stimulus waveforms through differential patterns of precise (∼6 ms) spike timing, while those with minimal intrinsic variability do not. A simple mathematical model provides an explanation for this result. Postsynaptic central neurons also demonstrate precise spike timing, suggesting that higher brain areas also represent self-motion using temporally precise firing. These findings demonstrate that two distinct sensory channels represent vestibular information: one using rate coding and the other that takes advantage of precise spike timing."</span>

We found that a newly defined T cell cytokine, Eta-1, is expressed at very high levels in T cells from MRL/l mice but not normal mouse strains and in a CD4-8- 45R+ T cell clone. The Eta-1 gene encodes a secreted protein that binds specifically to macrophages, possibly via a cell adhesion receptor, resulting in alterations in the mobility and activation state of this cell type (Patarca, R., G.

In addition, recent studies have indicated that Eta-1 can enhance secretion of IgM and IgG by mixtures of macrophages and B cells (Patarca, R., M. A. Lampe, M. V. Iregai, and H.

The major signal transducers for TNFRs are the family of TNF receptor associated factors (TRAFs). The direct interaction between TRAFs and the intracellular tails of TNFRs is the first step of this signal relay process. Structural studies have revealed a trimeric nature of TRAF2 and a symmetrical mode of receptor binding, suggesting the involvement of trivalent TNFR2-receptor interaction in the signal transduction. In this study, using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we report thermodynamic characterization of the interaction between TRAF2 and monomeric peptide sequences from TNFR members, including TNFR2, CD40, CD30, Ox40, and 4-1BB, and the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-transforming protein, latent infection membrane protein-1 (LMP1). The dissociation constants of the interaction were shown to range between 40 μM and 1.9 mM, which are substantially weaker than most protein–peptide interactions. The interaction is entirely driven by exothermic enthalpy, consistent with the abundance of polar contacts. The enthalpy of the interaction has a significant temperature dependence (ΔCp = −245 cal/mol⋅K). The unfavorable entropy in the interaction and the comparison with structural energetics calculations suggest the involvement of conformational rearrangement in the interaction. The low affinity of TRAF2 to monomeric receptor peptides further supports the importance of avidity contribution in TRAF2 recruitment by these receptors upon ligand-induced trimerization or higher order oligomerization."</span>

We then inferred functional connections in the SCN by applying the maximal information coefficient statistic to bioluminescence reporter data from individual neurons while they resynchronized their circadian cycling. Our results demonstrate that the functional network of circadian cells associated with resynchronization has small-world characteristics, with a node degree distribution that is exponential.

Homodimerization of myocardin is required for maximal transcriptional activity and provides a mechanism for cooperative activation of smooth muscle genes by SRF–myocardin complexes bound to different SRF binding sites.

Here, we report substantially improved gene expression prediction accuracy from DNA sequences through the use of a deep learning architecture, called Enformer, that is able to integrate information from long-range interactions (up to 100 kb away) in the genome. This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel reporter assays. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict enhancer–promoter interactions directly from the DNA sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of human disease associations and provide a framework to interpret cis -regulatory evolution."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The vomeronasal organ (VNO) detects pheromones in many vertebrate species but is likely to be vestigial in humans. TRPC2(TRP2) , a gene that is essential for VNO function in the mouse, is a pseudogene in humans. Because TRPC2 is expressed only in the VNO, the loss of selective pressure on this gene can serve as a molecular marker for the time at which the VNO became vestigial. By analyzing sequence data from the TRPC2 gene of 15 extant primate species, we provide evidence that the VNO was most likely functional in the common ancestor of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys and apes, but then became vestigial in the common ancestor of Old World monkeys and apes. We propose that, at this point in evolution, other modalities, notably the development of color vision, may have largely replaced signaling by pheromones."</span>

Luco et al. (p. 996 , published online 4 February) analyzed the alternative splicing of the human fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene in tissue culture cells and found that inclusion of exon IIIb or IIIc was modulated by the levels of histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3-K36me3) and H3-K4me3. Histone H3-K36me3 enrichment correlated with binding of the chromatin protein, MRG15. The MRG15 protein in turn recruited the polypyrimidine tract–binding protein (PTB) splicing factor, which acts to repress alternative exon inclusion, thus establishing a direct link between histone modifications and the splicing machinery."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The ETS gene family is frequently involved in chromosome translocations that cause human cancer, including prostate cancer, leukemia, and sarcoma. However, the mechanisms by which oncogenic ETS proteins, which are DNA-binding transcription factors, target genes necessary for tumorigenesis is not well understood. Ewing's sarcoma serves as a paradigm for the entire class of ETS-associated tumors because nearly all cases harbor recurrent chromosomal translocations involving ETS genes. The most common translocation in Ewing's sarcoma encodes the EWS/FLI oncogenic transcription factor. We used whole genome localization (ChIP-chip) to identify target genes that are directly bound by EWS/FLI. Analysis of the promoters of these genes demonstrated a significant over-representation of highly repetitive GGAA-containing elements (microsatellites). In a parallel approach, we found that EWS/FLI uses GGAA microsatellites to regulate the expression of some of its target genes including NR0B1 , a gene required for Ewing's sarcoma oncogenesis. The microsatellite in the NR0B1 promoter bound EWS/FLI in vitro and in vivo and was both necessary and sufficient to confer EWS/FLI regulation to a reporter gene. Genome wide computational studies demonstrated that GGAA microsatellites were enriched close to EWS/FLI-up-regulated genes but not down-regulated genes. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the ability of EWS/FLI to bind DNA and modulate gene expression through these repetitive elements depended on the number of consecutive GGAA motifs. These findings illustrate an unprecedented route to specificity for ETS proteins and use of microsatellites in tumorigenesis."</span>

We used crystallographic and biochemical approaches to gain insight into activating mutations in two noncatalytic p110α domains—the adaptor-binding and the helical domains. A structure of the adaptor-binding domain of p110α in a complex with the p85α inter–Src homology 2 (inter-SH2) domain shows that oncogenic mutations in the adaptor-binding domain are not at the inter-SH2 interface but in a polar surface patch that is a plausible docking site for other domains in the holo p110/p85 complex.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"INTRODUCTION To combat invading pathogens, cells develop an adaptive immune response by changing their own genetic information. In vertebrates, the generation of genetic variation (somatic hypermutation) is an essential process for diversification and affinity maturation of antibodies that function to detect and sequester various foreign biomolecules. The activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) carries out hypermutation by modifying deoxycytidine bases in the variable region of the immunoglobulin locus that produces antibody. AID-generated deoxyuridine in DNA is mutagenic as it can be miss-recognized as deoxythymine, resulting in C to T mutations. CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) is a prokaryotic adaptive immune system that records and degrades invasive foreign DNA or RNA. The CRISPR/Cas system cleaves and incorporates foreign DNA/RNA segments into the genomic region called the CRISPR array. The CRISPR array is transcribed to produce crispr-RNA that serves as guide RNA (gRNA) for recognition of the complementary foreign DNA/RNA in a ribonucleoprotein complex with Cas proteins, which degrade the target. The CRISPR/Cas system has been repurposed as a powerful genome editing tool, because it can be programmed to cleave specific DNA sequence by providing custom gRNAs. RATIONALE Although the precise mechanism by which AID specifically mutates the immunoglobulin locus remains elusive, targeting of AID activity is facilitated by the formation of a single-stranded DNA region, such as a transcriptional RNA/DNA hybrid (R-loop). The CRISPR/Cas system can be engineered to be nuclease-inactive. The nuclease-inactive form is capable of unfolding the DNA double strand in a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence-dependent manner so that the gRNA binds to complementary target DNA strand and forms an R-loop. The nuclease-deficient CRISPR/Cas system may serve as a suitable DNA-targeting module for AID to catalyze site-specific mutagenesis. RESULTS To determine whether AID activity can be specifically targeted by the CRISPR/Cas system, we combined dCas9 (a nuclease-deficient mutant of Cas9) from Streptococcus pyogenes and an AID ortholog, PmCDA1 from sea lamprey, to form a synthetic complex (Target-AID) by either engineering a fusion between the two proteins or attaching a SH3 (Src 3 homology) domain to the C terminus of dCas9 and a SHL (SH3 interaction ligand) to the C terminus of PmCDA1. Both of these complexes performed highly efficient site-directed mutagenesis. The mutational spectrum was analyzed in yeast and demonstrated that point mutations were dominantly induced at cytosines within the range of three to five bases surrounding the –18 position upstream of the PAM sequence on the noncomplementary strand to gRNA. The toxicity associated with the nuclease-based CRISPR/Cas9 system was greatly reduced in the Target-AID complexes. Combination of PmCDA1 with the nickase Cas9(D10A) mutant, which retains cleavage activity for noncomplementary single-stranded DNA, was more efficient in yeast but also induced deletions as well as point mutations in mammalian cells. Addition of the uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein, which blocks the initial step of the uracil base excision repair pathway, suppressed collateral deletions and further improved targeting efficiency. Potential off-target effects were assessed by whole-genome sequencing of yeast as well as deep sequencing of mammalian cells for regions that contain mismatched target sequences. These results showed that off-target effects were comparable to those of conventional CRISPR/Cas systems, with a reduced risk of indel formation. CONCLUSION By expanding the genome editing potential of the CRISPR/Cas9 system by deaminase-mediated hypermutation, Target-AID demonstrated a very narrow range of targeted nucleotide substitution without the use of template DNA. Nickase Cas9 and uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein can be used to boost the targeting efficiency. The reduced cytotoxicity will be beneficial for use in cells that are sensitive to artificial nucleases. Use of other types of nucleotide-modifying enzymes and/or other CRISPR-related systems with different PAM requirements will expand our genome-editing repertoire and capacity. A crippled CRISPR/Cas targets AID. In vertebrate adaptive immunity, cytosine deaminase (AID or PmCDA1) induces somatic hypermutation at single-stranded DNA regions formed during transcription. The bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 immunity system recognizes and cleaves invasive DNA in a gRNA-dependent manner. AID and nuclease-deficient CRISPR/Cas9 are engineered to form a hybrid complex (Target-AID) that performs programmable cytosine mutations in a range of a few bases surrounding the –18 position upstream of PAM sequence of the noncomplementary DNA strand."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"E2F-1, the first gene product identified among a family of E2F transcription factors, is thought to play a critical role in G1/S progression of the cell cycle. Transcriptional activities of E2F are modulated during the cell cycle, mainly by the formation of complexes between E2F and several key regulators of cell cycle such as the retinoblastoma protein and related proteins. To further understand the roles of E2F in the cell cycle progression, we have overexpressed exogenous E2F-1 by using a tetracycline-controlled expression system. We have found that the induced expression of E2F-1 in Rat-2 fibroblasts promotes S-phase entry and subsequently leads to apoptosis. The apoptosis occurs in an E2F-1 dose-dependent manner. Cells resistant to the induction of apoptosis have lost the ability to express exogenous E2F-1. Cells growing in low serum are more sensitive to the E2F-1-mediated cell death. Overexpression of E2F-1 mutants that impair DNA binding or transactivation does not alter cell cycle progression or induce apoptosis. These results define a novel pathway to apoptosis and demonstrate that premature S-phase entry is associated with apoptotic cell death."</span>

Yet, the contribution of DNA sequence, histone post-translational modifications, histone variant usage and other factors in shaping the architecture of chromatin, and the mechanisms by which this architecture modulates expression of specific genes are not yet completely understood. Here we use optical tweezers to study the roles that DNA sequence and the histone variant H2A.Z have in shaping the chromatin landscape at the promoters of two model genes, Cga and Lhb . Guided by MNase mapping of the promoters of these genes, we reconstitute nucleosomes that mimic those located near the transcriptional start site and immediately downstream (+1), and measure the forces required to disrupt these nucleosomes, and their mobility along the DNA sequence.

In type 2 diabetes (T2D), along with decrements in plasma glucose and insulin levels and increments in glucagon release, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors induce stimulation of endogenous glucose production (EGP) and a suppression of tissue glucose disposal (TGD). We measured fasting and postmeal glucose fluxes in 25 subjects without diabetes using a double glucose tracer technique; in these subjects and in 66 previously reported patients with T2D, we also estimated lipolysis (from [2H5]glycerol turnover rate and circulating free fatty acids, glycerol, and triglycerides), lipid oxidation (LOx; by indirect calorimetry), and ketogenesis (from circulating β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations). In both groups, empagliflozin administration raised EGP, lowered TGD, and stimulated lipolysis, LOx, and ketogenesis. The pattern of glycosuria-induced changes was similar in subjects without diabetes and in those with T2D but quantitatively smaller in the former. With chronic (4 weeks) versus acute (first dose) drug administration, glucose flux responses were attenuated, whereas lipid responses were enhanced; in patients with T2D, fasting β-hydroxybutyrate levels rose from 246 ± 288 to 561 ± 596 µmol/L (P &amp;lt; 0.01).

However, attempts to establish a causal relationship between somatic mutations and aging have been constrained by the lack of methods to directly identify mutational events in primary human tissues. Here we provide genome-wide mutation frequencies and spectra of human B lymphocytes from healthy individuals across the entire human lifespan using a highly accurate single-cell whole-genome sequencing method. We found that the number of somatic mutations increases from &lt;500 per cell in newborns to &gt;3,000 per cell in centenarians. We discovered mutational hotspot regions, some of which, as expected, were located at Ig genes associated with somatic hypermutation (SHM). B cell–specific mutation signatures associated with development, aging, or SHM were found. The SHM signature strongly correlated with the signature found in human B cell tumors, indicating that potential cancer-causing events are already present even in B cells of healthy individuals. We also identified multiple mutations in sequence features relevant to cellular function (i.e., transcribed genes and gene regulatory regions). Such mutations increased significantly during aging, but only at approximately one-half the rate of the genome average, indicating selection against mutations that impact B cell function.

Using a mouse model of liver carcinoma, where cellular senescence is triggered in vivo by inducible p53 expression, we demonstrated that NK cells participate in the elimination of senescent tumors. The elimination of senescent tumor cells is dependent on NKG2D. Interestingly, p53 restoration neither increases ligand expression nor increases the sensitivity to lysis by NK cells. Instead, p53 restoration caused tumor cells to secrete various chemokines with the potential to recruit NK cells. Antibody-mediated neutralization of CCL2, but not CCL3, CCL4 or CCL5, prevented NK cell recruitment to the senescent tumors and reduced their elimination.

JHMV infects a variety of CNS cell types during the acute phase of infection including ependymal cells, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendroglia, and rarely in neurons. Replication within the majority of CNS cell types is controlled by perforin-dependent virus-specific CTL. However, inhibition of viral replication in oligodendroglia occurs via a perforin-independent mechanism(s). The potential role for IFN-γ as mediator controlling JHMV replication in oligodendroglia was examined in mice deficient in IFN-γ secretion (IFN-γ0/0 mice). IFN-γ0/0 mice exhibited increased clinical symptoms and mortality associated with persistent virus, demonstrating an inability to control replication. Neither antiviral Ab nor CTL responses were diminished in the absence of IFN-γ, although increased IgG1 was detected in IFN-γ0/0 mice. Increased virus Ag in the absence of IFN-γ localized almost exclusively to oligodendroglia and was associated with increased CD8+ T cells localized within white matter. These data suggest that although perforin-dependent CTL control virus replication within astrocytes and microglia, which constitute the majority of infected CNS cells, IFN-γ is critical for control of viral replication in oligodendroglia. Therefore, different mechanisms are used by the host defenses to control virus replication within the CNS, dependent upon the phenotype of the targets of virus replication."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract The t(12;21)(p13;q22) translocation is the most common chromosomal abnormality yet identified in any pediatric leukemia and gives rise to the TEL-AML1 fusion product. To investigate the effects of TEL-AML1 on hematopoiesis, fetal liver hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) were transduced with retroviral vectors expressing this fusion protein. We show that TEL-AML1 dramatically alters differentiation of HPCs in vitro, preferentially promoting B-lymphocyte development, enhancing self-renewal of B-cell precursors, and leading to the establishment of long-term growth factor–dependent pre–B-cell lines. However, it had no effect on myeloid development in vitro. Further experiments were performed to determine whether TEL-AML1 also demonstrates lineage-specific activity in vivo. TEL-AML1–expressing HPCs displayed a competitive advantage in reconstituting both B-cell and myeloid lineages in vivo but had no effect on reconstitution of the T-cell lineage. Despite promoting these alterations in hematopoiesis, TEL-AML1 did not induce leukemia in transplanted mice. Our study provides a unique insight into the role of TEL-AML1 in leukemia predisposition and a potential model to study the mechanism of leukemogenesis associated with this fusion."</span>

Experiments recording from this circuit often report counterintuitive and seemingly contradictory findings. For example, the response of SST cells in mouse V1 to top-down behavioral modulation can change its sign when the visual input changes, a phenomenon that we call response reversal. We developed a theoretical framework to explain these seemingly contradictory effects as emerging phenomena in circuits with two key features: interactions between multiple neural populations and a nonlinear neuronal input-output relationship. Furthermore, we built a cortical circuit model which reproduces counterintuitive dynamics observed in mouse V1.

ROCs are present in the epidermis during normal tail development and specifically relocalize to the amputation plane of regeneration-competent tadpoles, forming the wound epidermis. Genetic ablation or manual removal of ROCs blocks regeneration, whereas transplantation of ROC-containing grafts induces ectopic outgrowths in early embryos.

Probes specific for four F-related genes were isolated and used to survey the collection by DNA hybridization. To estimate the genetic diversity of genes in F-like plasmids, DNA sequences were obtained for four plasmid genes. The phylogenetic relationships among the plasmids in the ECOR strains is very different from that of the strains themselves. This finding supports the view that plasmid transfer has been frequent within and between the major groups of ECOR. Furthermore, the sequences indicate that recombination between genes in plasmids takes place at a considerably higher frequency than that observed for chromosomal genes. The plasmid genes, and by inference the plasmids themselves, are mosaic in structure with different regions acquired from different sources. Comparison of gene sequences from a variety of naturally occurring plasmids suggested a plausible donor of some of the recombinant regions as well as implicating a chi site in the mechanism of genetic exchange. The relatively high rate of recombination in F-plasmid genes suggests that conjugational gene transfer may play a greater role in bacterial population structure than previously appreciated."</span>

Using a mass spectrometric approach to simultaneously monitor hundreds of lipids, we discovered that the size and abundance of two lipid virulence factors, phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) and sulfolipid-1 (SL-1), are controlled by the availability of a common precursor, methyl malonyl CoA (MMCoA). Consistent with this view, increased levels of MMCoA led to increased abundance and mass of both PDIM and SL-1. Furthermore, perturbation of MMCoA metabolism attenuated pathogen replication in mice. Importantly, we detected increased PDIM synthesis in bacteria growing within host tissues and in bacteria grown in culture on odd-chain fatty acids. Because M. tuberculosis catabolizes host lipids to grow during infection, we propose that growth of M. tuberculosis on fatty acids in vivo leads to increased flux of MMCoA through lipid biosynthetic pathways, resulting in increased virulence lipid synthesis. Our results suggest that the shift to host lipid catabolism during infection allows for increased virulence lipid anabolism by the bacterium."</span>

Because VEGF promotes the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells, we examined the possibility that it also stimulates the proliferation of neuronal precursors in murine cerebral cortical cultures and in adult rat brain in vivo . VEGF (&gt;10 ng/ml) stimulated 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation into cells that expressed immature neuronal marker proteins and increased cell number in cultures by 20–30%. Cultured cells labeled by BrdUrd expressed VEGFR2/Flk-1, but not VEGFR1/Flt-1 receptors, and the effect of VEGF was blocked by the VEGFR2/Flk-1 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU1498. Intracerebroventricular administration of VEGF into rat brain increased BrdUrd labeling of cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), where VEGFR2/Flk-1 was colocalized with the immature neuronal marker, doublecortin (Dcx). The increase in BrdUrd labeling after the administration of VEGF was caused by an increase in cell proliferation, rather than a decrease in cell death, because VEGF did not reduce caspase-3 cleavage in SVZ or SGZ. Cells labeled with BrdUrd after VEGF treatment in vivo include immature and mature neurons, astroglia, and endothelial cells. These findings implicate the angiogenesis factor VEGF in neurogenesis as well."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"In several cell types, specific membrane proteins are retained intracellularly and rapidly redistributed to the surface in response to stimulation. In fat and muscle, the GLUT4 glucose transporter is dynamically retained because it is rapidly internalized and slowly recycled to the plasma membrane. Insulin increases the recycling of GLUT4, resulting in a net translocation to the surface. We have shown that fibroblasts also have an insulin-regulated recycling mechanism. Here we show that GLUT4 is retained within the transferrin receptor-containing general endosomal recycling compartment in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells rather than being segregated to a specialized, GLUT4-recycling compartment. With the use of total internal reflection microscopy, we demonstrate that the TR and GLUT4 are transported from the pericentriolar recycling compartment in separate vesicles. These data provide the first functional evidence for the formation of distinct classes of vesicles from the recycling compartment. We propose that GLUT4 is dynamically retained within the endosomal recycling compartment in CHO cells because it is concentrated in vesicles that form more slowly than those that transport TR. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, cells that naturally express GLUT4, we find that GLUT4 is partially segregated to a separate compartment that is inaccessible to the TR. We present a model for the formation of this specialized compartment in fat cells, based on the general mechanism described in CHO cells, which may explain the increased retention of GLUT4 and its insulin-induced translocation in fat cells."</span>

Assessment of mechanism showed that maternal fear expression increases pups’ stress hormone corticosterone and amygdala activation to induce this cue-specific fear learning. Suppressing pups’ amygdala or preventing pups from mounting a stress response blocked this fear learning. Specific fears may thus be transferred across generations through maternal emotional communication and infant’s associative learning mechanisms.

The lack of suitable infected material has prevented direct demonstration of ancient septicemia; thus, the history of most infections such as plague remains hypothetical. The durability of dental pulp, together with its natural sterility, makes it a suitable material on which to base such research. We hypothesized that it would be a lasting refuge for Yersinia pestis , the plague agent. DNA extracts were made from the dental pulp of 12 unerupted teeth extracted from skeletons excavated from 16th and 18th century French graves of persons thought to have died of plague (“plague teeth”) and from 7 ancient negative control teeth. PCRs incorporating ancient DNA extracts and primers specific for the human β-globin gene demonstrated the absence of inhibitors in these preparations.

Yeast Atg8 and its mammalian homologue LC3 are ubiquitin‐like modifiers that are localized on isolation membranes and play crucial roles in the formation of autophagosomes. These proteins are also involved in selective incorporation of specific cargo molecules into autophagosomes, in which Atg8 and LC3 interact with Atg19 and p62, receptor proteins for vacuolar enzymes and disease‐related protein aggregates, respectively.

In patient-derived monocytes and macrophages, increased glucose uptake and glycolytic flux fuel the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which in turn promote dimerization of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and enable its nuclear translocation.

In this study, we investigated the relationship of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) systemic activity on clinical outcomes in RT-treated non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). IDO-mediated production of kynurenine and the kynurenine:tryptophan ratio in patient blood serum were determined for stage III NSCLC patients at times before, during, and after RT administration and then correlated to overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and disease progression rate in patients. We found the impact of RT on these serum IDO markers to be heterogeneous in patients. On average, kynurenine:tryptophan ratios were reduced during RT but restored after RT. Notably, both baseline levels of kynurenine:tryptophan and changes in the levels of kynurenine after RT were significantly associated with OS. When combined, favorable change and favorable baseline corresponded with very long-term OS (median OS was not reached after 57 months of median follow-up). Favorable change combined with unfavorable baseline still corresponded with a lack of distant metastases. Our results suggest that RT alters IDO-mediated immune status in NSCLC patients and that changes in this serum biomarker may be useful to predict outcomes and perhaps personalize RT dosage to improve survival. Significance: Radiotherapy appears to influence systemic IDO activity and to exert a significant impact on metastatic risk and overall survival, with possible implications for defining a biomarker to optimize radiation dose in patients to improve outcomes.

However, human Th17 cells appear to be resistant to suppression by CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells, suggesting that they may be regulated by alternative mechanisms. Herein we show that IL-10 and TGF-β suppressed IL-17 production by anti-CD3-stimulated PBMC from normal individuals. TGF-β also suppressed IL-17 production by purified CD4+ T cells, whereas the inhibitory effect of IL-10 on IL-17 production appears to be mediated predominantly by its effect on APC. An examination of patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) demonstrated that Ag-specific Th17 cells are induced during infection and that these cells are regulated by IL-10 and TGF-β. PBMC from HCV Ab-positive donors secreted IL-17, IFN-γ, IL-10, and TGF-β in response to stimulation with the HCV nonstructural protein 4 (NS4). Furthermore, NS4 induced innate TGF-β and IL-10 expression by monocytes from normal donors and at higher levels from HCV-infected patients. Neutralization of TGF-β, and to a lesser extent IL-10, significantly enhanced NS4-specific IL-17 and IFN-γ production by T cells from HCV-infected donors. Our findings suggest that both HCV-specific Th1 and Th17 cells are suppressed by NS4-induced production of the innate anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β. This may represent a novel immune subversion mechanism by the virus to evade host-protective immune responses.

In this study, direct intratumoral delivery of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding these cytokines produced robust anticancer responses in a broad range of tumor microenvironments. The addition of mRNA encoding the T cell costimulator OX40L increased complete response rates in treated and untreated distal tumors compared to the cytokine mRNAs alone. Mice exhibiting complete responses were subsequently protected from tumor rechallenge. Treatments with these mRNA mixtures induced downstream cytokine and chemokine expression, and also activated multiple dendritic cell (DC) and T cell types. Consistent with this, efficacy was dependent on Batf3-dependent cross-presenting DCs and cytotoxic CD8 + T cells. IL-23/IL-36γ/OX40L triplet mRNA mixture triggered substantial immune cell recruitment into tumors, enabling effective tumor destruction irrespective of previous tumoral immune infiltrates. Last, combining triplet mRNA with checkpoint blockade led to efficacy in models otherwise resistant to systemic immune checkpoint inhibition. Human cell studies showed similar cytokine responses to the individual components of this mRNA mixture, suggesting translatability of immunomodulatory activity to human patients."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The functions of the Snail family of zinc-finger transcription factors are essential during embryonic development. One of their best-known functions is to induce epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMTs), which convert epithelial cells into migratory mesenchymal cells. In recent years, many orthologues of the Snail family have been identified throughout the animal kingdom, and their study is providing new clues about the EMT-dependent and-independent functions of Snail proteins. Here, we discuss these functions and how they influence cell behaviour during development and during diseases such as metastatic cancer. From these findings, we propose that Snail genes act primarily as survival factors and inducers of cell movement, rather than as inducers of EMT or cell fate."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Wild-type and mutant human transferrin receptors have been expressed in chicken embryo fibroblasts using a helper-independent retroviral vector. The internalization of mutant human transferrin receptors, in which all but four of the 61 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain had been deleted, was greatly impaired. However, when expressed at high levels, such "tailless" mutant receptors could provide chicken embryo fibroblasts with sufficient iron from diferric human transferrin to support a normal rate of growth. As the rate of recycling of the mutant receptors was not significantly different from wild-type receptors, an estimate of relative internalization rates could be obtained from the distribution of receptors inside the cell and on the cell surface under steady-state conditions. This analysis and the results of iron uptake studies both indicate that the efficiency of internalization of tailless mutant receptors is approximately 10% that of wild-type receptors. Further studies of a series of mutant receptors with different regions of the cytoplasmic domain deleted suggested that residues within a 10-amino acid region (amino acids 19-28) of the human transferrin receptor cytoplasmic domain are required for efficient endocytosis. Insertion of this region into the cytoplasmic domain of the tailless mutant receptors restored high efficiency endocytosis. The only tyrosine residue (Tyr 20) in the cytoplasmic domain of the human transferrin receptor is found within this 10-amino acid region. A mutant receptor containing glycine instead of tyrosine at position 20 was estimated to be approximately 20% as active as the wild-type receptor. We conclude that the cytoplasmic domain of the transferrin receptor contains a specific signal sequence located within amino acid residues 19-28 that determines high efficiency endocytosis. Further, Tyr 20 is an important element of that sequence."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Migration of epithelial cells is essential for tissue morphogenesis, wound healing, and metastasis of epithelial tumors. Here we show that ARNO, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) GTPases, induces Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells to develop broad lamellipodia, to separate from neighboring cells, and to exhibit a dramatic increase in migratory behavior. This transition requires ARNO catalytic activity, which we show leads to enhanced activation of endogenous ARF6, but not ARF1, using a novel pulldown assay. We further demonstrate that expression of ARNO leads to increased activation of endogenous Rac1, and that Rac activation is required for ARNO-induced cell motility. Finally, ARNO-induced activation of ARF6 also results in increased activation of phospholipase D (PLD), and inhibition of PLD activity also inhibits motility. However, inhibition of PLD does not prevent activation of Rac. Together, these data suggest that ARF6 activation stimulates two distinct signaling pathways, one leading to Rac activation, the other to changes in membrane phospholipid composition, and that both pathways are required for cell motility."</span>

These six have breakpoints that are the most proximal of the set and constitute a graded series with those broken nearer the centromere which have the most abnormal phenotypes. The group of six defines three major regions that produce the endosperm effects. The remaining 32 translocations reduce kernel size very slightly, suggesting the presence of a fourth region distal to all break-points.—The affected class of kernels lacks a paternally derived representative of that segment of 10L translocated to the B centromeric element (B10 chromosome; 10 10 B10). An accompanying class of kernel in which the paternal B10 chromosome is duplicated in the endosperm (10 10 10B B10 B10) is normal. Kernels of the same endosperm constitution synthesized by introducing both 10 and B10 maternally, however, are defective, resembling 10 10 10B. Maternal B10's are therefore unable to compensate for the absence of a paternal B10.

In an effort to identify potential CaG receptor(s), we found that CaG-induced phagocyte migration was specifically attenuated by the bacterial chemotactic peptide fMLP, suggesting these two chemoattractants might share a receptor. In fact, CaG chemoattracts rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL cells) expressing the high affinity human fMLP receptor FPR, but not parental RBL cells or cells transfected with other chemoattractant receptors. In addition, a specific FPR Ab and a defined FPR antagonist, cyclosporin H, abolished the chemotactic response of phagocytes and FPR-transfected cells to CaG. Furthermore, CaG down-regulated the cell surface expression of FPR in association with receptor internalization. Unlike fMLP, CaG did not induce potent Ca2+ flux and was a relatively weaker activator of MAPKs through FPR. Yet CaG activated an atypical protein kinase C isozyme, protein kinase Cζ, which was essential for FPR to mediate the chemotactic activity of CaG. Thus, our studies identify CaG as a novel, host-derived chemotactic agonist for FPR and expand the functional scope of this receptor in inflammatory and immune responses."</span>

Biochemical and functional studies support a model in which IL-2 interacts with CD25 in the context of this FP in trans to form inactive head-to-tail dimers that slowly dissociate into an active monomer.

Transfer of CD4+ T cells that contained a mixture of Th and CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells (Treg cells) or Treg cells alone prevented effective adoptive immunotherapy.

These two forms of malnutrition, however, are closely related and often occur together in the same populations and often in the same children. Wasting and stunting are both associated with increased mortality, especially when both are present in the same child. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of these two different forms of malnutrition is needed to design efficient programs. A greatly reduced muscle mass is characteristic of severe wasting, but there is indirect evidence that it also occurs in stunting. A reduced muscle mass increases the risk of death during infections and also in many other different pathological situations. Reduced muscle mass may represent a common mechanism linking wasting and stunting with increased mortality. This suggests that to decrease malnutrition-related mortality, interventions should aim at preventing both wasting and stunting, which often share common causes. Also, this suggests that treatment interventions should focus on children who are both wasted and stunted and therefore have the greatest deficits in muscle mass, instead of focusing on one or the other form of malnutrition. Interventions should also focus on young infants and children, who have a low muscle mass in relation to body weight to start with. Using mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) to select children in need of treatment may represent a simple way to target young wasted and stunted children efficiently in situations where these two conditions are present. Wasting is also associated with decreased fat mass. A decreased fat mass is frequent but inconsistent in stunting. Fat secretes multiple hormones, including leptin, which may have a stimulating effect on the immune system. Depressed immunity resulting from low fat stores may also contribute to the increased mortality observed in wasting. This may represent another common mechanism linking wasting and stunting with increased mortality in situations where stunting is associated with reduced fat mass. Leptin may also have an effect on bone growth. This may explain why wasted children with low fat stores have reduced linear growth when their weight-for-height remains low. It may also explain the frequent association of stunting with previous episodes of wasting. Stunting, however, can occur in the absence of wasting and even in overweight children. Thus, food supplementation should be used with caution in populations where stunting is not associated with wasting and low fat stores."</span>

We propose an alternative description, which consists of determining suitable positions on the object—on the basis of its shape, surface roughness, and so on—and then moving one's thumb and fingers more or less independently to these positions. We modeled this description using a minimum-jerk approach, whereby the finger and thumb approach their respective target positions approximately orthogonally to the surface. Our model predicts how experimental variables such as object size, movement speed, fragility, and required accuracy will influence the timing and size of the maximum aperture of the hand. An extensive review of experimental studies on grasping showed that the predicted influences correspond to human behavior."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Growth hormone (GH) has long been known to stimulate lipolysis and insulin resistance; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that GH acutely induces lipolysis in cultured adipocytes. This effect is secondary to the reduced expression of a negative regulator of lipolysis, fat-specific protein 27 (FSP27; aka Cidec) at both the mRNA and protein levels. These effects are mimicked in vivo as transgenic overexpression of GH leads to a reduction of FSP27 expression. Mechanistically, we show GH modulation of FSP27 expression is mediated through activation of both MEK/ERK- and STAT5-dependent intracellular signaling. These two molecular pathways interact to differentially manipulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma activity (PPARγ) on the FSP27 promoter. Furthermore, overexpression of FSP27 is sufficient to fully suppress GH-induced lipolysis and insulin resistance in cultured adipocytes. Taken together, these data decipher a molecular mechanism by which GH acutely regulates lipolysis and insulin resistance in adipocytes."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract One of the most interesting challenges facing paleobiologists is explaining the Cambrian explosion, the dramatic appearance of most metazoan animal phyla in the Early Cambrian, and the subsequent stability of these body plans over the ensuing 530 million years. We propose that because phenotypic variation decreases through geologic time, because microRNAs (miRNAs) increase genic precision, by turning an imprecise number of mRNA transcripts into a more precise number of protein molecules, and because miRNAs are continuously being added to metazoan genomes through geologic time, miRNAs might be instrumental in the canalization of development. Further, miRNAs ultimately allow for natural selection to elaborate morphological complexity, because by reducing gene expression variability, miRNAs increase heritability, allowing selection to change characters more effectively. Hence, miRNAs might play an important role in shaping metazoan macroevolution, and might be part of the solution to the Cambrian conundrum."</span>

In soil, microorganisms are key components that determine life support functions, but the functional redundancy in the microbiota of most soils has long been thought to overwhelm microbial diversity–function relationships. We here show an inverse relationship between soil microbial diversity and survival of the invading species Escherichia coli O157:H7, assessed by using the marked derivative strain T. The invader's fate in soil was determined in the presence of ( i ) differentially constructed culturable bacterial communities, and ( ii ) microbial communities established using a dilution-to-extinction approach. Both approaches revealed a negative correlation between the diversity of the soil microbiota and survival of the invader. The relationship could be explained by a decrease in the competitive ability of the invader in species-rich vs. species-poor bacterial communities, reflected in the amount of resources used and the rate of their consumption. Soil microbial diversity is a key factor that controls the extent to which bacterial invaders can establish."</span>

About 50% of the T cells from young mice that formed conjugates with peptide-pulsed APC were found to form complexes, at the site of binding to the APC, containing CD3ε, linker for activation of T cells (LAT), and Zap-70 in a central area and c-Cbl, p95vav, Grb-2, PLCγ, Fyn, and Lck distributed more uniformly across the interface area. Two-color staining showed that those cells that were able to relocalize c-Cbl, LAT, CD3ε, or PLCγ typically relocalized all four of these components of the activation complex. About 75% of conjugates that rearranged LAT, c-Cbl, or PLCγ also exhibited cytoplasmic NF-AT migration to the T cell nucleus. Aging had two effects. First, it led to a diminution of ∼2-fold in the proportion of T cell/APC conjugates that could relocalize any of the nine tested proteins to the immune synapse. Second, aging diminished by ∼2-fold the frequency of cytoplasmic NF-AT migration among cells that could generate immune synapses containing LAT, c-Cbl, or PLCγ. Thus naive CD4 T cells from old mice exhibit at least two separable defects in the earliest stages of activation induced by peptide/MHC complexes."</span>

Models suggest that the rate of displacement of native by invasive alleles can be rapid and inevitable if they are favored by natural selection. We document the spread of a few introduced genes 90 km into a threatened native species (the California Tiger Salamander) in 60 years. Meanwhile, a majority of genetic markers (65 of 68) show little evidence of spread beyond the region where introductions occurred. Using computer simulations, we found that such a pattern is unlikely to emerge by chance among selectively neutral markers. Therefore, our results imply that natural selection has favored both the movement and fixation of these exceptional invasive alleles. The legal status of introgressed populations (native populations that are slightly genetically modified) is unresolved by the US Endangered Species Act.

Current treatments are empirical and often poorly efficacious, and there is a need for the development of new and efficient analgesics aimed at IBS patients. T-type calcium channels have previously been validated as a potential target to treat certain neuropathic pain pathologies. Here we report that T-type calcium channels encoded by the Ca V 3.2 isoform are expressed in colonic nociceptive primary afferent neurons and that they contribute to the exaggerated pain perception in a butyrate-mediated rodent model of IBS. Both the selective genetic inhibition of Ca V 3.2 channels and pharmacological blockade with calcium channel antagonists attenuates IBS-like painful symptoms. Mechanistically, butyrate acts to promote the increased insertion of Ca V 3.2 channels into primary sensory neuron membranes, likely via a posttranslational effect. The butyrate-mediated regulation can be recapitulated with recombinant Ca V 3.2 channels expressed in HEK cells and may provide a convenient in vitro screening system for the identification of T-type channel blockers relevant to visceral pain. These results implicate T-type calcium channels in the pathophysiology of chronic visceral pain and suggest Ca V 3.2 as a promising target for the development of efficient analgesics for the visceral discomfort and pain associated with IBS."</span>

Cell Biol. 127:1301–1310). Kinetochores in vertebrate cells contain multiple binding sites, and tension is generated at kinetochores after attachment to the plus ends of spindle microtubules. Checkpoint component Mad2 localizes selectively to unattached kinetochores (Chen, R.-H., J.C. Waters, E.D. Salmon, and A.W. Murray. 1996. Science. 274:242–246; Li, Y., and R. Benezra. Science. 274: 246–248) and disappears from kinetochores by late metaphase, when chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle. Here we show that Mad2 is lost from PtK1 cell kinetochores as they accumulate microtubules and re-binds previously attached kinetochores after microtubules are depolymerized with nocodazole. We also show that when kinetochore microtubules in metaphase cells are stabilized with taxol, tension at kinetochores is lost. The phosphoepitope 3f3/2, which has been shown to become dephosphorylated in response to tension at the kinetochore (Nicklas, R.B., S.C. Ward, and G.J. Gorbsky. 1995. J. Cell Biol. 130:929–939), is phosphorylated on all 22 kinetochores after tension is reduced with taxol. In contrast, Mad2 only localized to an average of 2.6 out of the 22 kinetochores in taxol-treated PtK1 cells. Therefore, loss of tension at kinetochores occupied by microtubules is insufficient to induce Mad2 to accumulate on kinetochores, whereas unattached kinetochores consistently bind Mad2. We also found that microinjecting antibodies against Mad2 caused cells arrested with taxol to exit mitosis after ∼12 min, while uninjected cells remained in mitosis for at least 6 h, demonstrating that Mad2 is necessary for maintenance of the taxol-induced mitotic arrest. We conclude that kinetochore microtubule attachment stops the Mad2 interactions at kinetochores which are important for inhibiting anaphase onset."</span>

Interaction of the VP8* domain of the spike protein VP4 with sialic acid was thought to be the key mediator for rotavirus infectivity. However, recent studies have indicated a role for nonsialylated glycoconjugates, including histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), in the infectivity of human rotaviruses. We sought to determine if the bovine rotavirus-derived VP8* of a reassortant neonatal G10P[11] virus interacts with hitherto uncharacterized glycans. In an array screen of &gt;600 glycans, VP8* P[11] showed specific binding to glycans with the Galβ1-4GlcNAc motif, which forms the core structure of type II glycans and is the precursor of H type II HBGA. The specificity of glycan binding was confirmed through hemagglutination assays; GST-VP8* P[11] hemagglutinates type O, A, and B red blood cells as well as pooled umbilical cord blood erythrocytes. Further, G10P[11] infectivity was significantly enhanced by the expression of H type II HBGA in CHO cells. The bovine-origin VP4 was confirmed to be essential for this increased infectivity, using laboratory-derived reassortant viruses generated from sialic acid binding rotavirus SA11-4F and a bovine G10P[11] rotavirus, B223. The binding to a core glycan unit has not been reported for any rotavirus VP4. Core glycan synthesis is constitutive in most cell types, and modification of these glycans is thought to be developmentally regulated. These studies provide the first molecular basis for understanding neonatal rotavirus infections, indicating that glycan modification during neonatal development may mediate the age-restricted infectivity of neonatal viruses."</span>

Reliable, timely, comprehensive, and consistent data are critical for measuring progress towards, and ultimately achieving, the SDGs. Data from citizen science represent one new source of data that could be used for SDG reporting and monitoring. However, information is still lacking regarding the current and potential contributions of citizen science to the SDG indicator framework. Through a systematic review of the metadata and work plans of the 244 SDG indicators, as well as the identification of past and ongoing citizen science initiatives that could directly or indirectly provide data for these indicators, this paper presents an overview of where citizen science is already contributing and could contribute data to the SDG indicator framework. The results demonstrate that citizen science is “already contributing” to the monitoring of 5 SDG indicators, and that citizen science “could contribute” to 76 indicators, which, together, equates to around 33%. Our analysis also shows that the greatest inputs from citizen science to the SDG framework relate to SDG 15 Life on Land, SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG 3 Good Health and Wellbeing, and SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation.

Synthesis of these molecules appears to require a member of the AfsA family of proteins (AfsA is required for A‐factor synthesis of the γ‐butyrolactone A‐factor and consequently for streptomycin production in Streptomyces griseus ). An afsA homologue, scbA , was identified in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and was found to lie adjacent to a divergently transcribed gene, scbR , which encodes a γ‐butyrolactone binding protein. Gel retardation assays and DNase I footprinting studies revealed DNA binding sites for ScbR at − 4 to − 33 nt with respect to the scbA transcriptional start site, and at − 42 to − 68 nt with respect to the scbR transcriptional start site. Addition of the γ‐butyrolactone SCB1 of S. coelicolor resulted in loss of the DNA‐binding ability of ScbR. A scbA mutant produced no γ‐butyrolactones, yet overproduced two antibiotics, actinorhodin (Act) and undecylprodigiosin (Red), whereas a deletion mutant of scbR also failed to make γ‐butyrolactones and showed delayed Red production. These phenotypes differ markedly from those expected by analogy with the S. griseus A‐factor system. Furthermore, transcription of scbR increased, and that of scbA was abolished, in an scbR mutant, indicating that ScbR represses its own expression while activating that of scbA. In the scbA mutant, expression of both genes was greatly reduced. Addition of SCB1 to the scbA mutant induced transcription of scbR , but did not restore scbA expression, indicating that the deficiency in scbA transcription in the scbA mutant is not solely due to the inability to produce SCB1, and that ScbA is a positive autoregulator in addition to being required for γ‐butyrolactone production. Overall, these results indicate a complex mechanism for γ‐butyrolactone‐mediated regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis in S. coelicolor ."</span>

In flowering plants, the haploid male gametophytes (pollen grains) are generated in the anther from reproductive cells called microsporocytes. Several types of somatic cells ensure successful pollen development, and thus reproduction. However, it is not clear what genes regulate the differentiation of these diverse, highly specialized cells in the anther. We report here the isolation and characterization of a novel Arabidopsis thaliana male sterile mutant, excess microsporocytes1 ( ems1 ), that produces excess microsporocytes, lacks tapetal cells, and abnormally maintains middle layer cells. Although the meiotic nuclear division in the ems1 mutant is normal, the microsporocytes do not undergo cytokinesis, resulting in failed microsporogenesis and male sterility. The EMS1 gene encodes a putative leucine-rich repeat receptor protein kinase (LRR-RPK), and its expression is associated with the differentiation of the microsporocytes and tapetal cells, suggesting that EMS1 mediates signals that control the fate of reproductive cells and their contiguous somatic cells."</span>

One of these inversions, IN(rrnD-rrnE), had been propagated in a commonly used subline of E. coli K-12 for approximately 30 yr before its discovery, a fact that illustrates the absence of obvious detrimental effects associated with the inversion. We found that culturing under conditions requiring repeated transition from stationary phase to rapid growth led to the replacement of IN(rrnD-rrnE) cells by cells that had undergone either of two types of additional chromosomal inversion: one type fully restored the wild-type order, while the other partially restored it. The partial reinversion was also between rrn operons, but it left a small transposition. The tendency for overgrowth by these revertants persisted through several rounds of periodic selection. In contrast, the other inversion, IN(rrnG-rrnE), was associated with severe, detrimental effects. The effects of IN(rrnG-rrnE) were also alleviated by full or partial reinversion. The probable relationship between the severity of the effects caused by the inversions and the degree of displacement of the replication origin is discussed. Spontaneous inversion events between rrn operons separated by 18% of the chromosome were estimated to occur at a frequency of roughly 10(-5). If extended to natural situations, the growth disadvantage together with the relatively high frequency of reinversion suggest that clones of cells with an inversion between these rrn operons would be readily overgrown by revertants."</span>

Development has been limited to a small palette of organics that are aqueous soluble and tend to display the necessary redox reversibility within the water stability window. We show how molecular engineering of fluorenone enables the alcohol electro-oxidation needed for reversible ketone hydrogenation and dehydrogenation at room temperature without the use of a catalyst. Flow batteries based on these fluorenone derivative anolytes operate efficiently and exhibit stable long-term cycling at ambient and mildly increased temperatures in a nondemanding environment. These results expand the palette to include reversible ketone to alcohol conversion but also suggest the potential for identifying other atypical organic redox couple candidates."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Rare nucleated fetal cells circulate within maternal blood. Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis by isolation and genetic analysis of these cells is currently being undertaken. We sought to determine if genetic evidence existed for persistent circulation of fetal cells from prior pregnancies. Venous blood samples were obtained from 32 pregnant women and 8 nonpregnant women who had given birth to males 6 months to 27 years earlier. Mononuclear cells were sorted by flow cytometry using antibodies to CD antigens 3, 4, 5, 19, 23, 34, and 38. DNA within sorted cells, amplified by PCR for Y chromosome sequences, was considered predictive of a male fetus or evidence of persistent male fetal cells. In the 32 pregnancies, male DNA was detected in 13 of 19 women carrying a male fetus. In 4 of 13 pregnancies with female fetuses, male DNA was also detected. All of the 4 women had prior pregnancies; 2 of the 4 had prior males and the other 2 had terminations of pregnancy. In 6 of the 8 nonpregnant women, male DNA was detected in CD34+CD38+ cells, even in a woman who had her last son 27 years prior to blood sampling. Our data demonstrate the continued maternal circulation of fetal CD34+ or CD34+CD38+ cells from a prior pregnancy. The prolonged persistence of fetal progenitor cells may represent a human analogue of the microchimerism described in the mouse and may have significance in development of tolerance of the fetus. Pregnancy may thus establish a long-term, low-grade chimeric state in the human female."</span>

The primary structure, intestinal cell distribution, and developmental appearance of cryptdin mRNA have been determined. Cryptdin mRNA is 450-480 nucleotides long. Translation of the partial cryptdin cDNA sequence reveals a 70-amino acid open reading frame that includes 32 carboxy-terminal residues that align with those in the consensus sequence, C.CR...C....ER..G.C....CCR, which is a common feature of leukocyte defensins and lung corticostatins (Selsted, M.

In situ hybridization of cryptdin cDNA to paraformaldehyde-fixed, frozen sections of adult jejunum and ileum showed intense and specific labeling of epithelial cells in the base of all crypts. Analysis of sections from suckling mice showed that cryptdin mRNA is detectable in 10-20% of crypts in 10-d-old mice, in approximately 80% of crypts in 16-d-old mice, and in all crypts of mice 20 d and older. During the fourth week, the sequence accumulates in crypts to the maximal adult level. Cryptdin mRNA content in adult small intestine is independent both of T cell involvement and luminal bacteria. The role of cryptdin in small bowel physiology remains to be determined: cryptdin may inhibit bacterial translocation, modulate intestinal hormone synthesis, influence hormonal sensitivity of the intestinal epithelium, or exhibit a multiplicity of related activities."</span>

When the treated RNAs were translated in vitro, a dramatic increase in expression of a downstream luciferase coding region was observed. The cDNA sequence data are consistent with deamination of the adenosine in the UAG stop codon to inosine by double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase.

Adult flies in which dDuox expression is silenced showed a marked increase in mortality rate even after a minor infection through ingestion of microbe-contaminated food. This could be restored by the specific reintroduction of dDuox, demonstrating that this oxidase generates a unique epithelial oxidative burst that limits microbial proliferation in the gut.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Motivation: Emergence of genetic data coupled to longitudinal electronic medical records (EMRs) offers the possibility of phenome-wide association scans (PheWAS) for disease–gene associations. We propose a novel method to scan phenomic data for genetic associations using International Classification of Disease (ICD9) billing codes, which are available in most EMR systems. We have developed a code translation table to automatically define 776 different disease populations and their controls using prevalent ICD9 codes derived from EMR data. As a proof of concept of this algorithm, we genotyped the first 6005 European–Americans accrued into BioVU, Vanderbilt's DNA biobank, at five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with previously reported disease associations: atrial fibrillation, Crohn's disease, carotid artery stenosis, coronary artery disease, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. The PheWAS software generated cases and control populations across all ICD9 code groups for each of these five SNPs, and disease-SNP associations were analyzed. The primary outcome of this study was replication of seven previously known SNP–disease associations for these SNPs. Results: Four of seven known SNP–disease associations using the PheWAS algorithm were replicated with P-values between 2.8 × 10−6 and 0.011. The PheWAS algorithm also identified 19 previously unknown statistical associations between these SNPs and diseases at P &amp;lt; 0.01. This study indicates that PheWAS analysis is a feasible method to investigate SNP–disease associations. Further evaluation is needed to determine the validity of these associations and the appropriate statistical thresholds for clinical significance.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"It has been proposed that the urokinase receptor (u-PAR) is essential for the various biological roles of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) in vivo, and that smooth muscle cells require u-PA for migration during arterial neointima formation. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the role of u-PAR during this process in mice with targeted disruption of the u-PAR gene (u-PAR−/−). Surprisingly, u-PAR deficiency did not affect arterial neointima formation, neointimal cell accumulation, or migration of smooth muscle cells. Indeed, topographic analysis of arterial wound healing after electric injury revealed that u-PAR−/− smooth muscle cells, originating from the uninjured borders, migrated over a similar distance and at a similar rate into the necrotic center of the wound as wild-type (u-PAR+/+) smooth muscle cells. In addition, u-PAR deficiency did not impair migration of wounded cultured smooth muscle cells in vitro. There were no genotypic differences in reendothelialization of the vascular wound. The minimal role of u-PAR in smooth muscle cell migration was not because of absent expression, since wild-type smooth muscle cells expressed u-PAR mRNA and functional receptor in vitro and in vivo. Pericellular plasmin proteolysis, evaluated by degradation of 125I-labeled fibrin and activation of zymogen matrix metalloproteinases, was similar for u-PAR−/− and u-PAR+/+ cells. Immunoelectron microscopy of injured arteries in vivo revealed that u-PA was bound on the cell surface of u-PAR+/+ cells, whereas it was present in the pericellular space around u-PAR−/− cells. Taken together, these results suggest that binding of u-PA to u-PAR is not required to provide sufficient pericellular u-PA–mediated plasmin proteolysis to allow cellular migration into a vascular wound."</span>

We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci—e.g., seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

Methods are needed to determine the significance of these changes while accounting for the enormous number of genes. We describe a method, Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), that assigns a score to each gene on the basis of change in gene expression relative to the standard deviation of repeated measurements. For genes with scores greater than an adjustable threshold, SAM uses permutations of the repeated measurements to estimate the percentage of genes identified by chance, the false discovery rate (FDR). When the transcriptional response of human cells to ionizing radiation was measured by microarrays, SAM identified 34 genes that changed at least 1.5-fold with an estimated FDR of 12%, compared with FDRs of 60 and 84% by using conventional methods of analysis. Of the 34 genes, 19 were involved in cell cycle regulation and 3 in apoptosis.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Comparative expressed sequence hybridization (CESH) to chromosomes is a recently introduced technique that identifies chromosomal regions corresponding to a differential gene expression. This technique is analogous to comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) that detects genomic imbalances. We applied CESH for the study of hairy cell leukemia (HCL), a disorder with a largely unknown expression profile. Twelve HCL cases with spleen involvement were investigated by CESH and CGH. While the latter analysis identified only a few nonrecurrent genomic imbalances, CESH showed a consistent expression profile in all HCL cases. In addition, pairing normal spleen with normal lymph node, a “spleen signature” was established by CESH. This signature most likely reflects the expression profile of spleen-specific components, such as the sinusoidal lining cells from the red pulp and the marginal zone B cells from the white pulp. Imprint of the spleen signature was found in the HCL expression profile, suggesting that HCL may originate from a particular B-cell subset present in these splenic components. Besides pairing HCL with normal lymph node and spleen, we identified an “HCL signature” comprising several chromosome regions with altered expression. The most significantly underexpressed regions include 3p24, 3p21, 3q13.3-q22, 4p16, 11q23, 14q22-q24, 15q21-q22, 15q24-q25, and 17q22-q24; and 13q31 and Xq13.3-q21 were the most significantly overexpressed. These regions possibly harbor genes related to the biology and the pathogenesis of HCL. Their identification warrants further molecular investigations."</span>

TGFβ-2, a constituent of the ocular microenvironment, converts conventional APCs that are pulsed with Ag into cells that induce immune deviation when injected into naive mice. TGFβ-2-treated APCs under-express IL-12 and CD40, and over-express active TGFβ. We have examined transcriptional changes within macrophage hybridoma no. 59, which promotes Th1 cell differentiation, and TGFβ-2-treated no. 59 as well as macrophage hybridoma no. 63, both of which induce immune deviation similar to anterior chamber-associated immune deviation. Immune deviation-inducing hybridomas up-regulated expression of thrombospondin, TGFβ, IFN-α and β, murine macrophage elastase, and macrophage-inflammatory protein-2 genes, while down-regulating expression of the genes for NF-κB and CD40. Based on the known properties of these gene products, a model is proposed in which these gene products, alone and through interacting signaling pathways, confer upon conventional APCs the capacity to create and surround themselves with an immunomodulatory microenvironment. The model proposes that the pleiotropic effects of thrombospondin are primarily responsible for creating this microenvironment that is stabile, rich in active TGFβ and IFN-α and β, deficient in IL-12, and chemoattractant via macrophage-inflammatory protein-2 for NK T cells.

Both the absolute number and the rate of discovery of natural products have increased significantly in recent years. However, there is a perception and concern that the fundamental novelty of these discoveries is decreasing relative to previously known natural products. This study presents a quantitative examination of the field from the perspective of both number of compounds and compound novelty using a dataset of all published microbial and marine-derived natural products. This analysis aimed to explore a number of key questions, such as how the rate of discovery of new natural products has changed over the past decades, how the average natural product structural novelty has changed as a function of time, whether exploring novel taxonomic space affords an advantage in terms of novel compound discovery, and whether it is possible to estimate how close we are to having described all of the chemical space covered by natural products. Our analyses demonstrate that most natural products being published today bear structural similarity to previously published compounds, and that the range of scaffolds readily accessible from nature is limited. However, the analysis also shows that the field continues to discover appreciable numbers of natural products with no structural precedent.

Herein, we report the codeposition of Pt nanoparticles and CuO x clusters on TiO 2 (PC‐50) and use of the resulting photocatalyst for OCM in a flow reactor operated at room temperature under atmospheric pressure for the first time. The optimized Cu 0.1 Pt 0.5 /PC‐50 sample showed a highest yield of C 2 product of 6.8 μmol h −1 at a space velocity of 2400 h −1 , more than twice the sum of the activity of Pt/PC‐50 (1.07 μmol h −1 ) and Cu/PC‐50 (1.9 μmol h −1 ), it might also be the highest among photocatalytic methane conversions reported so far under atmospheric pressure. A high C 2 selectivity of 60 % is also comparable to that attainable by conventional high‐temperature (&gt;943 K) thermal catalysis.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Despite the inarguable relevance of p53 in cancer, genome-wide studies relating endogenous p53 activity to the expression of lncRNAs in human cells are still missing. Here, by integrating RNA-seq with p53 ChIP-seq analyses of a human cancer cell line under DNA damage, we define a high-confidence set of 18 lncRNAs that are p53 transcriptional targets. We demonstrate that two of the p53-regulated lncRNAs are required for the efficient binding of p53 to some of its target genes, modulating the p53 transcriptional network and contributing to apoptosis induction by DNA damage. We also show that the expression of p53-lncRNAs is lowered in colorectal cancer samples, constituting a tumour suppressor signature with high diagnostic power. Thus, p53-regulated lncRNAs establish a positive regulatory feedback loop that enhances p53 tumour suppressor activity. Furthermore, the signature defined by p53-regulated lncRNAs supports their potential use in the clinic as biomarkers and therapeutic targets."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays an essential role in growth and patterning of the mammary gland, and alterations in its signaling have been shown to illicit biphasic effects on tumor progression and metastasis. We demonstrate in mice that TGF-β (Tgfβ) regulates the expression of a non-canonical signaling member of the wingless-related protein family, Wnt5a. Loss of Wnt5a expression has been associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients; however, data are lacking with regard to a functional role for Wnt5a in mammary gland development. We show that Wnt5a is capable of inhibiting ductal extension and lateral branching in the mammary gland. Furthermore, Wnt5a-/- mammary tissue exhibits an accelerated developmental capacity compared with wild-type tissue, marked by larger terminal end buds, rapid ductal elongation, increased lateral branching and increased proliferation. Additionally, dominant-negative interference of TGF-β signaling impacts not only the expression of Wnt5a, but also the phosphorylation of discoidin domain receptor 1 (Ddr1), a receptor for collagen and downstream target of Wnt5a implicated in cell adhesion/migration. Lastly,we show that Wnt5a is required for TGF-β-mediated inhibition of ductal extension in vivo and branching in culture.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Bisphosphonates are widely used agents for the treatment of malignant bone disease. They inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and can have direct effects on cancer cells. In this study, we investigated whether the anticancer activity of the third-generation bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (ZOL) could be enhanced by combination with the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). We found that ZOL and SAHA cooperated to induce cell death in the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3. The effect was synergistic, as evidenced by combination index isobologram analysis. ZOL and SAHA synergized to induce dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, to activate caspase-3, and to trigger DNA fragmentation, showing that the combination of ZOL and SAHA resulted in the initiation of apoptosis. Because ZOL acts by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway, thereby preventing protein prenylation, we explored whether the mevalonate pathway was also the target of the cooperative action of ZOL and SAHA. We found that geranylgeraniol, but not farnesol, significantly reduced ZOL/SAHA-induced cell death, indicating that the synergistic action of the agents was due to the inhibition of geranylgeranylation. Consistently, a direct inhibitor of geranylgeranylation, GGTI-298, synergized with SAHA to induce cell death, whereas an inhibitor of farnesylation, FTI-277, had no effect. In addition, SAHA synergized with mevastatin, an inhibitor of the proximal enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. These in vitro findings provide a rationale for an in vivo exploration into the potential of combining SAHA and ZOL, or other inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway, as an effective strategy for anticancer therapy.

We therefore tested whether ETRB has a similar role in malignant transformation of melanoma. When tested in culture, we find that the selective ETRB antagonist BQ788 can inhibit the growth of seven human melanoma cell lines, but not a human kidney cell line. This inhibition often is associated with increases in pigmentation and in the dendritic shape that is characteristic of mature melanocytes. In three cell lines we also observe a major increase in cell death. In contrast, the endothelin receptor A (ETRA) antagonist BQ123 does not have these effects, although all the cell lines express both ETRA and ETRB mRNA. Extending these studies in vivo , we find that administration of BQ788 significantly slows human melanoma tumor growth in nude mice, including a complete growth arrest in half of the mice treated systemically. Histological examination of tumor sections suggests that BQ788 also enhances melanoma cell death in vivo . Thus, ETRB inhibitors may be beneficial for the treatment of melanoma."</span>

Neurophysiol. 78: 1531–1549, 1997. Ocular motoneuron firing rate is linearly related to conjugate eye position with slope K above recruitment threshold θ. Within the population of ocular motoneurons K increases as θ increases. These differences in firing rate between motoneurons might be determined either by the intrinsic properties of the motoneurons, or by differences in synaptic input to them, or by a combination of the two. This question was investigated by simulating the input signal to medial rectus motoneurons (MR-MNs) from internuclear neurons of the abducens nucleus (INNs). INNs were represented as input nodes in a two-layer neural net, each with weighted connections to every output node representing an MR-MN. Individual simulated MR-MNs were assigned parameters corresponding to an intrinsic current threshold I R and an intrinsic frequency-current ( f-I) slope γ. Their firing rates were calculated from these parameters, together with the effective synaptic current produced by their synaptically weighted INN inputs, with the use of assumptions employed in computer simulations of spinal motoneuron pools. The experimentally observed firing rates of MR-MNs served as training data for the net. The following two training conditions were used: 1) synaptic weights were fixed and the intrinsic parameters of the MR-MNs were allowed to vary, corresponding to the situation in which each MR-MN receives a common synaptic drive and 2) intrinsic MR-MN properties were fixed and synaptic weights were allowed to vary. In each case, the varying quantities were trained with a form of gradient descent error reduction. The simulations revealed the following three problems with the common-drive model: 1) the recruitment of INNs produced nonlinear responses in MR-MNs with low θs; 2) the range of I R s required to reproduce the observed range of θ were generally larger than those measured experimentally for cat ocular motoneurons; and 3) the intrinsic f-I slope γ increased with I R . Experimental data from cat indicate that γ decreases with I R . When synaptic weights were allowed to vary, all three problems with the common-drive model were overcome. This required MR-MNs receiving selective input from INNs with similar firing rate thresholds. These results suggest that the differences in firing rate properties among MR-MNs in relation to steady-state eye position cannot be derived from their intrinsic properties alone but result at least partly from differences in their synaptic inputs. An MR-MN's individual set of synaptic inputs constitutes, in effect, a premotor receptive field."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Purpose: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors selectively target homologous recombination (HR)–defective cells and show good clinical activity in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer associated with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. A high proportion (up to 50%) of sporadic epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC) could be deficient in HR due to genetic or epigenetic inactivation of BRCA1/BRCA2 or other HR genes. Therefore, there is a potential for extending the use of PARP inhibitors to these patients if HR status can be identified. We developed a functional assay of HR status in primary cultures of EOCs based on Rad51 focus formation that correlates well with sensitivity to the potent PARP inhibitor AG014699. Experimental Design: Primary cultures were derived from ascitic fluid from patients with EOCs. HR status was investigated by γH2AX and Rad51 focus formation by immunofluorescence. Cytotoxicity to PARP inhibitors was tested by sulforhodamine B and survival assay. Results: Twenty-five cultures were evaluated for HR status and cytotoxicity to PARP inhibitor. Following exposure to AG014699, there was an increase in Rad51 foci (HR competent) in 9 of 24 (36%) but no increase (HR deficient) in 16 of 24 (64%) cultures. Cytotoxicity was observed in 15 of 16 (93%) HR-deficient samples but not in 9 of 9 HR-competent samples following 24-hour exposure to 10 μmol/L AG014699. Conclusion: HR status can be determined in primary cancer samples by Rad51 focus formation, and this correlates with in vitro response to PARP inhibition.

Here we rewire the identity of conventional human ESCs into a more immature state that extensively shares defining features with pluripotent mouse ESCs. This was achieved by ectopic induction of Oct4, Klf4, and Klf2 factors combined with LIF and inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) pathway. Forskolin, a protein kinase A pathway agonist which can induce Klf4 and Klf2 expression, transiently substitutes for the requirement for ectopic transgene expression. In contrast to conventional human ESCs, these epigenetically converted cells have growth properties, an X-chromosome activation state (XaXa), a gene expression profile, and a signaling pathway dependence that are highly similar to those of mouse ESCs. Finally, the same growth conditions allow the derivation of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells with similar properties as mouse iPS cells. The generation of validated “naïve” human ESCs will allow the molecular dissection of a previously undefined pluripotent state in humans and may open up new opportunities for patient-specific, disease-relevant research."</span>

Here, we investigated the mechanism of prolonged ISG expression and its role in IFN responsiveness during HCV infection in relation to unphosphorylated IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (U-ISGF3), recently identified as a tripartite transcription factor formed by high levels of IFN response factor 9 (IRF9), STAT1, and STAT2 without tyrosine phosphorylation of the STATs. The level of U-ISGF3, but not tyrosine phosphorylated STAT1, is significantly elevated in response to IFN-λ and IFN-β during chronic HCV infection. U-ISGF3 prolongs the expression of a subset of ISGs and restricts HCV chronic replication. However, paradoxically, high levels of U-ISGF3 also confer unresponsiveness to IFN-α therapy. As a mechanism of U-ISGF3–induced resistance to IFN-α, we found that ISG15, a U-ISGF3-induced protein, sustains the abundance of ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18), a negative regulator of IFN signaling. Our data demonstrate that U-ISGF3 induced by IFN-λs and -β drives prolonged expression of a set of ISGs, leading to chronic activation of innate responses and conferring a lack of response to IFN-α in HCV-infected liver."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Robust seasonal dynamics in microbial community composition have previously been observed in the English Channel L4 marine observatory. These could be explained either by seasonal changes in the taxa present at the L4 site, or by the continuous modulation of abundance of taxa within a persistent microbial community. To test these competing hypotheses, deep sequencing of 16S rRNA from one randomly selected time point to a depth of 10 729 927 reads was compared with an existing taxonomic survey data covering 6 years. When compared against the 6-year survey of 72 shallow sequenced time points, the deep sequenced time point maintained 95.4% of the combined shallow OTUs. Additionally, on average, 99.75%±0.06 (mean±s.d.) of the operational taxonomic units found in each shallow sequenced sample were also found in the single deep sequenced sample. This suggests that the vast majority of taxa identified in this ecosystem are always present, but just in different proportions that are predictable. Thus observed changes in community composition are actually variations in the relative abundance of taxa, not, as was previously believed, demonstrating extinction and recolonization of taxa in the ecosystem through time."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Significance This study offers a new perspective on an age-old question: When does cooperation emerge in populations? Two-player games used to study this question produce an array of counterintuitive results. And yet a consensus has emerged that, in an evolving population, cooperation tends to triumph over cheating––through reciprocity and generosity. But, what happens when players can influence not only their tendencies to cooperate, but also the rewards they reap for cooperation? We analyze coevolution of strategies and payoffs and find that, as individuals maximize the benefits of cooperation, they often pave the way for its collapse. Our analysis provides a framework for studying the coevolution of games and strategies, and suggests that maintaining cooperation may be more difficult than previously thought."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Recombination plays a crucial role in meiosis, ensuring the proper segregation of chromosomes. Recent linkage disequilibrium (LD) and sperm-typing studies suggest that recombination rates vary tremendously across the human genome, with most events occurring in narrow “hotspots.” To examine variation in fine-scale recombination patterns among individuals, we used dense, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data collected in nuclear families to localize crossovers with high spatial resolution. This analysis revealed that overall recombination hotspot usage is similar in males and females, with individual hotspots often active in both sexes. Across the genome, roughly 60% of crossovers occurred in hotspots inferred from LD studies. Notably, however, we found extensive and heritable variation among both males and females in the proportion of crossovers occurring in these hotspots."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Bacterial plasmids maintain their number of copies by negative regulatory systems that adjust the rate of replication per plasmid copy in response to fluctuations in the copy number. Three general classes of regulatory mechanisms have been studied in depth, namely those that involve directly repeated sequences (iterons), those that use only antisense RNAs and those that use a mechanism involving an antisense RNA in combination with a protein. The first class of control mechanism will not be discussed here. Within the second class (the most ‘classical’ one), exciting insights have been obtained on the molecular basis of the inhibition mechanism that prevents the formation of a long‐range RNA structure (pseudoknot), which is an example of an elegant solution reached by some replicons to control their copy number. Among the third class, it is possible to distinguish between (i) cases in which proteins play an auxiliary role; and (ii) cases in which transcriptional repressor proteins play a real regulatory role. This latter type of regulation is relatively new and seems to be widespread among plasmids from Gram‐positive bacteria, at least for the rolling circle‐replicating plasmids of the pMV158 family and the theta‐replicating plasmids of the Inc18 streptococcal family."</span>

We found that these cells rarely divide within their niche but change properties abruptly when stimulated to exit.

Signaling from the c-Kit receptor tyrosine kinase is essential for primordial germ cell (PGC) growth both in vivo and in vitro . Many downstream effectors of the c-Kit signaling pathway have been identified in other cell types but how these molecules control PGC survival and proliferation are unknown. Determination of the c-Kit effectors acting in PGCs has been hampered by the lack of effective methods to easily manipulate gene expression in these cells. We overcame this problem by testing the efficacy of retroviral-mediated gene transfer for manipulating gene expression in mammalian germ cells. We found that PGCs can be successfully infected with a variety of types of retroviruses. We used this method to demonstrate an important role for the AKT kinase in regulating PGC growth. Such technology for manipulating gene expression in PGCs will allow many of the molecular mechanisms regulating germ cell growth, behavior, and differentiation to be comprehensively analyzed."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Imatinib has revolutionized drug therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Preclinical studies were promising but the results of clinical trials by far exceeded expectations. Responses in chronic phase are unprecedented, with rates of complete cytogenetic response (CCR) of more than 40% in patients after failure of interferon-α (IFN) and more than 80% in newly diagnosed patients, a level of efficacy that led to regulatory approval in record time. While most of these responses are stable, resistance to treatment after an initial response is common in more advanced phases of the disease. Mutations in the kinase domain (KD) of BCR-ABL that impair imatinib binding have been identified as the leading cause of resistance. Patients with CCR who achieve a profound reduction of BCR-ABL mRNA have a very low risk of disease progression. However, residual disease usually remains detectable with reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), indicating that disease eradication may pose a significant challenge. The mechanisms underlying the persistence of minimal residual disease are unknown. In this manuscript, we review the preclinical and clinical development of imatinib for the therapy of CML, resistance and strategies that may help to eliminate resistant or residual leukemia."</span>

Observations from the genomic databases for several eukaryotic species suggest that duplicate genes arise at a very high rate, on average 0.01 per gene per million years. Most duplicated genes experience a brief period of relaxed selection early in their history, with a moderate fraction of them evolving in an effectively neutral manner during this period. However, the vast majority of gene duplicates are silenced within a few million years, with the few survivors subsequently experiencing strong purifying selection.

The aggregate embryos were cultured to the 16-cell stage, at which time a second marker was used to label the outside cell population. The embryos were then disaggregated and each cell was examined to determine its labelling pattern. From this analysis, we calculated the relative contributions to the inside cell population of the 16-cell embryo of older and younger cells. Older cells were found to contribute preferentially. However, if the construction of the aggregate 8-cell embryo was delayed until each of the contributing 2/8 cell pairs had undergone intercellular flattening and then had been exposed to medium low in calcium to reverse this flattening immediately prior to aggregation, the advantage possessed by the older cells was lost. These results support the suggestion that older cells derived from early-dividing 4-cell blastomeres contribute preferentially to the inner cell mass as a result of being early-flattening cells."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Beyond their contribution to basic metabolism, the major cellular organelles, in particular mitochondria, can determine whether cells respond to stress in an adaptive or suicidal manner. Thus, mitochondria can continuously adapt their shape to changing bioenergetic demands as they are subjected to quality control by autophagy, or they can undergo a lethal permeabilization process that initiates apoptosis. Along similar lines, multiple proteins involved in metabolic circuitries, including oxidative phosphorylation and transport of metabolites across membranes, may participate in the regulated or catastrophic dismantling of organelles. Many factors that were initially characterized as cell death regulators are now known to physically or functionally interact with metabolic enzymes. Thus, several metabolic cues regulate the propensity of cells to activate self-destructive programs, in part by acting on nutrient sensors. This suggests the existence of “metabolic checkpoints” that dictate cell fate in response to metabolic fluctuations. Here, we discuss recent insights into the intersection between metabolism and cell death regulation that have major implications for the comprehension and manipulation of unwarranted cell loss."</span>

MAb MRK16 is a MAb that has been shown to react with an epitope in P170 located on the external face of the plasma membrane of multidrug-resistant human cells. MAb C219 has been shown to react with P170 in many mammalian species, and detects an epitope located on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Using MRK16, we have previously described the localization of P170 on the bile canalicular face of hepatocytes, the apical surface of proximal tubular cells in kidney, and the surface epithelium in the lower GI tract in normal human tissues. In this work, we report that MRK16 also detects P170 in the capillaries of some human brain samples. A similar pattern was found using MAb C219 in rat tissues. in addition, MAb C219 showed intense localization in selected skeletal muscle fibers and all cardiac muscle fibers in rat and human tissues. ATPase cytochemistry showed that these reactive skeletal muscle fibers were of the type I (slow-twitch) class. Other additional sites of C219 reactivity in rat tissues were found in pancreatic acini, seminal vesicle, and testis. Electrophoretic gel immunoblotting showed two protein bands reactive with MAb C219. In liver, MAb C219 reacted with a approximately 170 KD band. In skeletal and cardiac muscle, MAb C219 reacted with a approximately 200 KD band which migrated in the same position as myosin. This band also reacted with an antibody to skeletal muscle myosin. This result suggests that C219 may crossreact with the heavy chain of muscle myosin in cardiac and skeletal muscle.

Despite their importance, little is known about how these essential structures develop. Recent genetic fate maps indicate that hRPe and hCPe descend from the same pool of dorsal neuroectodermal progenitor cells of the rhombic lip. A linear developmental progression has been assumed,with the rhombic lip producing non-mitotic hRPe, and seemingly uniform hRPe transforming into hCPe. Here, we show that hRPe is not uniform but rather comprises three spatiotemporal fields, which differ in organization,proliferative state, order of emergence from the rhombic lip, and molecular profile of either the constituent hRPe cells themselves and/or their parental progenitors. Only two fields contribute to hCPe. We also present evidence for an hCPe contribution directly by the rhombic lip at late embryonic stages when hRPe is no longer present; indeed, the production interval for hCPe by the rhombic lip is surprisingly extensive. Further, we show that the hCPe lineage appears to be unique among the varied rhombic lip-derived lineages in its proliferative response to constitutively active Notch1 signaling. Collectively, these findings provide a new platform for investigating hRPe and hCPe as neural organizing centers and provide support for the model that they are themselves patterned structures that might be capable of influencing neural development along multiple spatial and temporal axes."</span>

This pattern of expression is determined both by the activity of the late promoter and by the inhibition of late region expression in less well differentiated cells. Inhibition of L1 and L2 mRNA production in nonpermissive cells must occur since the late region potentially could be transcribed from early region promoters. Nuclear runoff analysis of the late region has demonstrated that up to 95% of transcripts which are initiated in the early region in nonpermissive cells terminate within the late region upstream of the late polyadenylation site (C. C. Baker and J. Noe, J. Virol. 63:3529-3534, 1989). However, very few of the primary transcripts which include the late polyadenylation site are processed into mRNA. In this study, we have used expression vectors to characterize an inhibitory element active in nonpermissive cells which is located in the late 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). While the late polyadenylation site is functional in these cells, a 53-bp element in the late 3'UTR reduces levels of polyadenylated cytoplasmic RNA. This element inhibited chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression 6- to 10-fold when cloned in the sense orientation into the 3'UTR of a CAT expression vector. No block to expression was seen when the fragment was cloned immediately downstream of the poly(A) site, in an intron upstream of the CAT coding sequence, or in an antisense orientation in the 3'UTR. When the same fragment was deleted from a BPV-1 L1 expression vector, a sixfold increase in mRNA levels was seen. Actinomycin D chase experiments using BPV-1 L1 expression vectors indicated that the element does not destabilize cytoplasmic polyadenylated RNA. Therefore, the element must act before the mature mRNA reaches the cytoplasm. The data presented are consistent with effects on nuclear stability and/or inhibition of polyadenylation or nuclear transport."</span>

The cytological hallmark of this process is the accumulation of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear protein at telomeric DNA to form ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs). Here, the de novo formation of a telomeric PML nuclear subcompartment was investigated by recruiting APB protein components. We show that functionally distinct proteins were able to initiate the formation of bona fide APBs with high efficiency in a self-organizing and self-propagating manner. These included: (1) PML and Sp100 as the constituting components of PML nuclear bodies, (2) telomere repeat binding factors 1 and 2 (TRF1 and TRF2, respectively), (3) the DNA repair protein NBS1 and (4) the SUMO E3 ligase MMS21, as well as the isolated SUMO1 domain, through an interacting domain of another protein factor. By contrast, the repair factors Rad9, Rad17 and Rad51 were less efficient in APB nucleation but were recruited to preassembled APBs. The artificially created APBs induced telomeric extension through a DNA repair mechanism, as inferred from their colocalization with sites of non-replicative DNA synthesis and histone H2A.X phosphorylation, and an increase of the telomere repeat length. These activities were absent after recruitment of the APB factors to a pericentric locus and establish APBs as functional intermediates of the ALT pathway."</span>

Suppressor phenomena were detected by testing the protection afforded by lymphoid cells from nondiabetic NOD mice against diabetes transfer in irradiated recipients. Transfer of diabetes was delayed by reconstituting recipients with spleen cells from nondiabetic NOD donors. The greatest protection against diabetes transfer was conferred by spleen cells from 8-wk-old nondiabetic female NOD mice. Depletion experiments showed that the protection was dependent on CD4+ cells.

They originated as bacterial symbionts whose host cells acquired respiration from the precursor of the mitochondrion, and oxygenic photosynthesis from the precursor of the chloroplast. The host cells also acquired genetic information from their symbionts, eventually incorporating much of it into their own genomes. Genes of the eukaryotic cell nucleus now encode most mitochondrial and chloroplast proteins. Genes are copied and moved between cellular compartments with relative ease, and there is no obvious obstacle to successful import of any protein precursor from the cytosol. So why are any genes at all retained in cytoplasmic organelles? One proposal is that these small but functional genomes provide a location for genes that is close to, and in the same compartment as, their gene products. This co-location facilitates rapid and direct regulatory coupling. Redox control of synthesis de novo is put forward as the common property of those proteins that must be encoded and synthesized within mitochondria and chloroplasts. This testable hypothesis is termed CORR, for co -location for r edox r egulation. Principles, predictions and consequences of CORR are examined in the context of competing hypotheses and current evidence."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Objective: To investigate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) in patients with mild to moderate myasthenia gravis (MG) exacerbation. Methods: We performed a prospective, open-label, phase 3 trial in patients with MG aged 18 years or older and mild to moderate worsening (transition from Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America class I to II/III or class II to III), treated with SCIg (2 g/kg), self-administered over 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in quantitative MG (QMG) score from baseline to study end at 6 weeks. Secondary endpoints included change in manual muscle testing (MMT), MG activities of daily living (MG-ADL), and MG composite (MGC) scores, as well as occurrence of adverse events, and tolerability as assessed via Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM). Results: Twenty-two of 23 patients completed the study. QMG score decreased from 14.9 ± 4.1 to 9.8 ± 5.6 ( p &lt; 0.0001), MMT score decreased from 16.8 ± 9.5 to 5.2 ± 4.5 ( p &lt; 0.0001), MG-ADL score decreased from 9.5 ± 3.0 to 4.6 ± 3.0 ( p &lt; 0.0001), and MGC score decreased from 17.4 ± 5.0 to 5.6 ± 4.5 ( p &lt; 0.0001). Satisfaction by TSQM was high (79.6 ± 15.6%). Common adverse events included headache and injection site reactions. No serious adverse events occurred. Conclusions: SCIg is well-tolerated, safe, and effective in mild to moderate MG exacerbation. Comparative safety and efficacy must be established with randomized controlled trials. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence that in patients with mild to moderate MG exacerbation, SCIg is safe and effective in reducing MG disability measures."</span>

We tested the hypothesis that circulating growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) concentrations in early pregnancy, whose gene is implicated in hyperemesis gravidarum, are associated with nausea and vomiting. Methods: Blood samples for the measurement of GDF15 and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) concentrations were obtained early in the second trimester (median 15.1 (interquartile range 14.4-15.7) weeks) of pregnancy from 791 women from the Cambridge Baby Growth Study, a prospective pregnancy and birth cohort. During each trimester participants completed a questionnaire which included questions about nausea, vomiting and antiemetic use. Associations with pre-pregnancy body mass indexes (BMI) were validated in 231 pregnant NIPTeR Study participants. Results: Circulating GDF15 concentrations were higher in women reporting vomiting in the second trimester than in women reporting no pregnancy nausea or vomiting: 11,581 (10,977-12,219) (n=175) vs. 10,593 (10,066-11,147) (n=193) pg/mL, p=0.02). In women who took antiemetic drugs during pregnancy (n=11) the GDF15 levels were also raised 13,157 (10,558-16,394) pg/mL (p =0.04). Serum GFD15 concentrations were strongly positively correlated with hCG levels but were inversely correlated with maternal BMIs, a finding replicated in the NIPTeR Study. Conclusions: Week 15 serum GDF15 concentrations are positively associated with second trimester vomiting and maternal antiemetic use in pregnancy. Given GDF15’s site of action in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the brainstem and its genetic associations with hyperemesis gravidarum, these data support the concept that GDF15 may be playing a pathogenic role in pregnancy-associated vomiting."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Some ovarian cancer cells in vivo are in a reversible quiescent state where they can contribute to cancer spread under favorable growth conditions. The serine/threonine kinase Mirk/dyrk1B was expressed in each of seven ovarian cancer cell lines and in 21 of 28 resected human ovarian cancers, and upregulated in 60% of the cancers. Some ovarian cancer cells were found in a G0 quiescent state, with the highest fraction in a line with an amplified Mirk gene. Suboptimal culture conditions increased the G0 fraction in SKOV3 and TOV21G, but not OVCAR4 cultures. Less than half as many OVCAR4 cells survived under suboptimal culture conditions as shown by total cell numbers, dye exclusion viability studies, and assay of cleaved apoptotic marker proteins. G0 arrest in TOV21G and SKOV3 cells led to increased levels of Mirk, the CDK inhibitor p27, p130/Rb2, and p130/Rb2 complexed with E2F4. The G0 arrest was transient, and cells exited G0 when fresh nutrients were supplied. Depletion of p130/Rb2 reduced the G0 fraction, increased cell sensitivity to serum‐free culture and to cisplatin, and reduced Mirk levels. Mirk contributed to G0 arrest by destabilization of cyclin D1. In TOV21G cells, but not in normal diploid fibroblasts, Mirk depletion led to increased apoptosis and loss of viability. Because Mirk is expressed at low levels in most normal adult tissues, the elevated Mirk protein levels in ovarian cancers may present a novel therapeutic target, in particular for quiescent tumor cells which are difficult to eradicate by conventional therapies targeting dividing cells."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Mitochondrial oxidative damage contributes to a range of degenerative diseases. Consequently, the selective inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative damage is a promising therapeutic strategy. One way to do this is to invent antioxidants that are selectively accumulated into mitochondria within patients. Such mitochondria-targeted antioxidants have been developed by conjugating the lipophilic triphenylphosphonium cation to an antioxidant moiety, such as ubiquinol or α-tocopherol. These compounds pass easily through all biological membranes, including the blood-brain barrier, and into muscle cells and thus reach those tissues most affected by mitochondrial oxidative damage. Furthermore, because of their positive charge they are accumulated several-hundredfold within mitochondria driven by the membrane potential, enhancing the protection of mitochondria from oxidative damage. These compounds protect mitochondria from damage following oral delivery and may therefore form the basis for mitochondria-protective therapies. Here we review the background and work to date on this class of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The aggregation of α-synuclein (aSyn) leading to the formation of Lewy bodies is the defining pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Rare familial PD-associated mutations in aSyn render it aggregation-prone; however, PD patients carrying wild type (WT) aSyn also have aggregated aSyn in Lewy bodies. The mechanisms by which WT aSyn aggregates are unclear. Here, we report that inflammation can play a role in causing the aggregation of WT aSyn. We show that activation of the inflammasome with known stimuli results in the aggregation of aSyn in a neuronal cell model of PD. The insoluble aggregates are enriched with truncated aSyn as found in Lewy bodies of the PD brain. Inhibition of the inflammasome enzyme caspase-1 by chemical inhibition or genetic knockdown with shRNA abated aSyn truncation. In vitro characterization confirmed that caspase-1 directly cleaves aSyn, generating a highly aggregation-prone species. The truncation-induced aggregation of aSyn is toxic to neuronal culture, and inhibition of caspase-1 by shRNA or a specific chemical inhibitor improved the survival of a neuronal PD cell model. This study provides a molecular link for the role of inflammation in aSyn aggregation, and perhaps in the pathogenesis of sporadic PD as well."</span>

The dominantly inherited Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is of particular interest because of the diversity of childhood and adult tumors that occur in affected individuals. The rarity and high mortality of LFS precluded formal linkage analysis. The alternative approach was to select the most plausible candidate gene. The tumor suppressor gene, p53, was studied because of previous indications that this gene is inactivated in the sporadic (nonfamilial) forms of most cancers that are associated with LFS. Germ line p53 mutations have been detected in all five LFS families analyzed. These mutations do not produce amounts of mutant p53 protein expected to exert a trans-dominant loss of function effect on wild-type p53 protein.

Despite progress in characterizing and inhibiting these processes, in situ mechanistic and structural studies remain challenging. This is because these operations are executed by individual viral preintegration complexes deep within cells. We therefore reconstituted and imaged the early stages of HIV-1 replication in a cell-free system. HIV-1 cores released from permeabilized virions supported efficient, capsid-dependent endogenous reverse transcription to produce double-stranded DNA genomes, which sometimes looped out from ruptured capsid walls. Concerted integration of both viral DNA ends into a target plasmid then proceeded in a cell extract–dependent reaction.

SARS-CoV mediates receptor binding and entry by its spike (S) glycoprotein, and infection is sensitive to lysosomotropic agents that perturb endosomal pH. We demonstrate here that the lysosomotropic-agent-mediated block to SARS-CoV infection is overcome by protease treatment of target-cell-associated virus. In addition, SARS-CoV infection was blocked by specific inhibitors of the pH-sensitive endosomal protease cathepsin L. A cell-free membrane-fusion system demonstrates that engagement of receptor followed by proteolysis is required for SARS-CoV membrane fusion and indicates that cathepsin L is sufficient to activate membrane fusion by SARS-CoV S. These results suggest that SARS-CoV infection results from a unique, three-step process: receptor binding and induced conformational changes in S glycoprotein followed by cathepsin L proteolysis within endosomes. The requirement for cathepsin L proteolysis identifies a previously uncharacterized class of inhibitor for SARS-CoV infection."</span>

Like fragile X patients, FMR1 -knockout ( FMR1 -KO) mice lack the normal fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and show both cognitive alterations and an immature neuronal morphology. We reared FMR1 -KO mice in a C57BL/6 background in enriched environmental conditions to examine the possibility that experience-dependent stimulation alleviates their behavioral and neuronal abnormalities. FMR1 -KO mice kept in standard cages were hyperactive, displayed an altered pattern of open field exploration, and did not show habituation. Quantitative morphological analyses revealed a reduction in basal dendrite length and branching together with more immature-appearing spines along apical dendrites of layer five pyramidal neurons in the visual cortex. Enrichment largely rescued these behavioral and neuronal abnormalities while increasing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor subunit 1 (GluR1) levels in both genotypes. Enrichment did not, however, affect FMRP levels in the WT mice.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Carbon monoxide (CO) is a ubiquitous atmospheric trace gas produced by natural and anthropogenic sources. Some aerobic bacteria can oxidize atmospheric CO and, collectively, they account for the net loss of ~250 teragrams of CO from the atmosphere each year. However, the physiological role, genetic basis, and ecological distribution of this process remain incompletely resolved. In this work, we addressed these knowledge gaps through culture-based and culture-independent work. We confirmed through shotgun proteomic and transcriptional analysis that the genetically tractable aerobic soil actinobacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis upregulates expression of a form I molydenum–copper carbon monoxide dehydrogenase by 50-fold when exhausted for organic carbon substrates. Whole-cell biochemical assays in wild-type and mutant backgrounds confirmed that this organism aerobically respires CO, including at sub-atmospheric concentrations, using the enzyme. Contrary to current paradigms on CO oxidation, the enzyme did not support chemolithoautotrophic growth and was dispensable for CO detoxification. However, it significantly enhanced long-term survival, suggesting that atmospheric CO serves a supplemental energy source during organic carbon starvation. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that atmospheric CO oxidation is widespread and an ancestral trait of CO dehydrogenases. Homologous enzymes are encoded by 685 sequenced species of bacteria and archaea, including from seven dominant soil phyla, and we confirmed genes encoding this enzyme are abundant and expressed in terrestrial and marine environments. On this basis, we propose a new survival-centric model for the evolution of aerobic CO oxidation and conclude that, like atmospheric H2, atmospheric CO is a major energy source supporting persistence of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria in deprived or changeable environments."</span>

We provide a principled account identifying three inferential steps optimizing this arbitration through the emergence of (i) factual reactive inferences in paralimbic prefrontal regions in rodents; (ii) factual proactive inferences in lateral prefrontal regions in primates and (iii) counterfactual reactive and proactive inferences in human frontopolar regions. The theory clarifies the integration of model-free and model-based RL through the notion of strategy creation.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) are 21 nucleotides long, double stranded RNA fragments that are identical in sequence to the target mRNA. We designed 3 such siRNA against the Her2/neu (HER2) gene. The HER2 gene is known to play an important role in the oncogenesis of several types of cancers, such as breast, ovarian, colon and gastric cancers. Introduction of the siRNA into HER2 positive tumor lines in vitro greatly reduced the cell surface expression of the HER2 protein. Concurrently, a range of effects on cell physiology, such as growth inhibition or apoptosis, was observed. The expression of HLA class I was observed to be upregulated when HER2 was silenced with siRNA. Treatment of SKBr3 and MCF7/HER2 tumor cell lines with the HER2 siRNA resulted in growth arrest of cells in the late G 1 /S‐phase.

Cells previously have been identified in vivo using exogenously added fluorescent labels, limiting observations to a few cell divisions, or by natural markers (e.g. melanin) expressed only by specific cell types. Here we tested the utility of stable green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transfected cells for monitoring and quantifying sequential steps in the metastatic process. Using CHO-K1 cells that stably express GFP, we document the visualization and quantification by intravital videomicroscopy of sequential steps in metastasis within mouse liver, from initial arrest of cells in the microvasculature to the growth and angiogenesis of metastases. Individual, non-dividing cells, as well as micro- and macrometastases could clearly be detected and quantified, as could fine cellular details such as pseudopodial projections, even after extended periods of in vivo growth. We quantified the size distribution of micrometastases and their locations relative to the liver surface using 50 micrometer thick formalin-fixed tissue sections. The data suggest preferential growth and survival of micrometastases near the liver surface. Furthermore, we observed a small population of single cells that persisted over the 11 day observation period, which may represent dormant cells with potential for subsequent proliferation.

Little is known, however, regarding whether presynaptic regulation of multitransmitter neurons influences all transmission from these neurons. Using the identified neurons and motor networks in the crab stomatogastric ganglion, we document the ability of presynaptic inhibition to selectively inhibit peptidergic cotransmission. Specifically, we determine that the gastropyloric receptor (GPR) proprioceptor neuron uses presynaptic inhibition to selectively regulate peptidergic cotransmission from the axon terminals of MCN1, a projection neuron that drives the biphasic (retraction, protraction) gastric mill (chewing) rhythm. MCN1 drives this rhythm via fast GABAergic excitation of the retraction neuron Int1 and slow peptidergic excitation of the lateral gastric (LG) protraction neuron. We first demonstrate that GPR inhibition of the MCN1 axon terminals is serotonergic and then establish that this serotonergic inhibition weakens MCN1 peptidergic excitation of LG without altering MCN1 GABAergic excitation of Int1. At the circuit level, we show that this selective regulation of MCN1 peptidergic cotransmission is necessary for the normal GPR regulation of the gastric mill rhythm. This is the first demonstration, at the level of individual identified neurons, that a presynaptic input can selectively regulate a subset of coreleased transmitters. This selective regulation changes the balance of cotransmitter actions by the target multitransmitter neuron, thereby enabling this neuron to have state-dependent actions on its target network. This finding reveals additional flexibility afforded by the ability of neurons to corelease multiple neurotransmitters."</span>

The precise mechanisms governing maturation of phagosomes into phagolysosomes are not completely understood. Here, we applied the property of pathogenic mycobacteria to cause phagosome maturation arrest in infected macrophages as a tool to dissect critical steps in phagosomal biogenesis. We report the requirement for 3-phosphoinositides and acquisition of Rab5 effector early endosome autoantigen (EEA1) as essential molecular events necessary for phagosomal maturation. Unlike the model phagosomes containing latex beads, which transiently recruited EEA1, mycobacterial phagosomes excluded this regulator of vesicular trafficking that controls membrane tethering and fusion processes within the endosomal pathway and is recruited to endosomal membranes via binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns[3]P). Inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3′(OH)-kinase (PI-3K) activity diminished EEA1 recruitment to newly formed latex bead phagosomes and blocked phagosomal acquisition of late endocytic properties, indicating that generation of PtdIns(3)P plays a role in phagosomal maturation. Microinjection into macrophages of antibodies against EEA1 and the PI-3K hVPS34 reduced acquisition of late endocytic markers by latex bead phagosomes, demonstrating an essential role of these Rab5 effectors in phagosomal biogenesis. The mechanism of EEA1 exclusion from mycobacterial phagosomes was investigated using mycobacterial products. Coating of latex beads with the major mycobacterial cell envelope glycosylated phosphatidylinositol lipoarabinomannan isolated from the virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, inhibited recruitment of EEA1 to latex bead phagosomes, and diminished their maturation. These findings define the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and EEA1 recruitment as: (a) important regulatory events in phagosomal maturation and (b) critical molecular targets affected by M. tuberculosis.

Transient inhibition of 5-HTT during early development with fluoxetine, a commonly used serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor, produced abnormal emotional behaviors in adult mice. This effect mimicked the behavioral phenotype of mice genetically deficient in 5-HTT expression. These findings indicate a critical role of serotonin in the maturation of brain systems that modulate emotional function in the adult and suggest a developmental mechanism to explain how low-expressing 5-HTT promoter alleles increase vulnerability to psychiatric disorders."</span>

However, the correlation between malaria intestinal pathology and intestinal microbiota has not been investigated. In the present study, infection of C57BL/6 mice with P . berghei ANKA ( Pb A) caused intestinal pathological changes, such as detachment of epithelia in the small intestines and increased intestinal permeability, which correlated with development with experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). Notably, an apparent dysbiosis occurred, characterized by a reduction of Firmicutes and an increase in Proteobacteria. Furthermore, some genera of microbiota correlated with parasite growth and/or ECM development. By contrast, BALB/c mice are resistant to ECM and exhibit milder intestinal pathology and dysbiosis. These results indicate that the severity of cerebral and intestinal pathology coincides with the degree of alteration in microbiota.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Type 2 cytokines regulate fibrotic liver pathology in mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni. Switching the immune response to a type 1-dominant reaction has proven highly effective at reducing the pathologic response. Activation of NOS-2 is critical, because type 1-deviated/NO synthase 2 (NOS-2)-deficient mice completely fail to control their response. Here, we demonstrate the differential regulation of NOS-2 and arginase type 1 (Arg-1) by type 1/type 2 cytokines in vivo and for the first time show a critical role for arginase in the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis. Using cytokine-deficient mice and two granuloma models, we show that induction of Arg-1 is type 2 cytokine dependent. Schistosome eggs induce Arg-1, while Mycobacterium avium-infected mice develop a dominant NOS-2 response. IFN-γ suppresses Arg-1 activity, because type 1 polarized IL-4/IL-10-deficient, IL-4/IL-13-deficient, and egg/IL-12-sensitized animals fail to up-regulate Arg-1 following egg exposure. Notably, granuloma size decreases in these type-1-deviated/Arg-1-unresponsive mice, suggesting an important regulatory role for Arg-1 in schistosome egg-induced pathology. To test this hypothesis, we administered difluoromethylornithine to block ornithine-aminodecarboxylase, which uses the product of arginine metabolism, l-ornithine, to generate polyamines. Strikingly, granuloma size and hepatic fibrosis increased in the ornithine-aminodecarboxylase-inhibited mice. Furthermore, we show that type 2 cytokine-stimulated macrophages produce proline under strict arginase control. Together, these data reveal an important regulatory role for the arginase biosynthetic pathway in the regulation of inflammation and demonstrate that differential activation of Arg-1/NOS-2 is a critical determinant in the pathogenesis of granuloma formation."</span>

We used sequence analysis and 3D structural modeling to determine which Drosophila GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) are likely to interact with Cdc42 and identified RhoGAP19D as the only high-probability Cdc42GAP required for polarity in the follicular epithelium. RhoGAP19D is recruited by α-catenin to lateral E-cadherin adhesion complexes, resulting in exclusion of active Cdc42 from the lateral domain. rhogap19d mutants therefore lead to lateral Cdc42 activity, which expands the apical domain through increased Par-6/aPKC activity and stimulates lateral contractility through the myosin light chain kinase, Genghis khan (MRCK). This causes buckling of the epithelium and invasion into the adjacent tissue, a phenotype resembling that of precancerous breast lesions. Thus, RhoGAP19D couples lateral cadherin adhesion to the apical localization of active Cdc42, thereby suppressing epithelial invasion."</span>

In this paper, we examined cell sheets formed by an epithelial (Eph4) cell line by structure illumination microscopy and found a previously not clearly described planar apical network of noncentrosomal microtubules (MTs) in which the sides of the MT bundles were associated with tight junctions (TJs). In a gel overlay assay with taxol-stabilized MTs, cingulin showed strong binding to MTs, and a domain analysis showed that this binding occurred through cingulin’s N-terminal region. The association of planar apical MTs with TJs was compromised by cingulin knockdown (KD) or the expression of dephosphomimetic mutants of cingulin at its adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) target sites, whereas phosphorylation at these sites facilitated cingulin–tubulin binding. In addition, although wild-type colonies formed spheres in 3D culture, the cingulin KD cells had anisotropic shapes.

The latter rod-like projections may exert sensory functions and are found in organisms as distant in evolution as mammals and amoeba such as Dictyostelium discoideum. In mammals, lamellipodia protrusion downstream of the small GTPase Rac1 requires a multimeric protein assembly, the WAVE-complex, which activates Arp2/3-mediated actin filament nucleation and actin network assembly. A current model of filopodia formation postulates that these structures arise from a dendritic network of lamellipodial actin filaments by selective elongation and bundling. Here, we have analyzed filopodia formation in mammalian cells abrogated in expression of essential components of the lamellipodial actin polymerization machinery. Cells depleted of the WAVE-complex component Nck-associated protein 1 (Nap1), and, in consequence, of lamellipodia, exhibited normal filopodia protrusion. Likewise, the Arp2/3-complex, which is essential for lamellipodia protrusion, is dispensable for filopodia formation. Moreover, genetic disruption of nap1 or the WAVE-orthologue suppressor of cAMP receptor (scar) in Dictyostelium was also ineffective in preventing filopodia protrusion. These data suggest that the molecular mechanism of filopodia formation is conserved throughout evolution from Dictyostelium to mammals and show that lamellipodia and filopodia formation are functionally separable."</span>

In order to investigate the neural substrates that implement these strategies, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment while humans performed a sequential action selection task under conditions that promoted the use of a specific RL strategy. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum increased activity in the exploratory condition; the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsomedial striatum and lateral cerebellum in the model-based condition; and the supplementary motor area, putamen and anterior cerebellum in the motor-memory condition.

The chaperonin GroEL has been proposed as a compensatory mechanism whereby endosymbiotic bacteria of aphids persist. Here, we show that endosymbiotic bacteria of insects from two phylogenetically very distant bacterial phyla have fixed amino acid substitutions by positive selection in functionally important GroEL regions involved in either GroES/peptide binding or in the en bloc movement of the GroEL apical domain.

The network of collagen IV is thought to define the scaffold integrating other components such as, laminins, nidogens or perlecan, into highly organized supramolecular architectures. To analyze the functional roles of the major collagen IV isoform α1(IV)2α2(IV) for basement membrane assembly and embryonic development, we generated a null allele of the Col4a1/2 locus in mice, thereby ablating both α-chains. Unexpectedly, embryos developed up to E9.5 at the expected Mendelian ratio and showed a variable degree of growth retardation. Basement membrane proteins were deposited and assembled at expected sites in mutant embryos, indicating that this isoform is dispensable for matrix deposition and assembly during early development. However, lethality occurred between E10.5-E11.5, because of structural deficiencies in the basement membranes and finally by failure of the integrity of Reichert's membrane. These data demonstrate for the first time that collagen IV is fundamental for the maintenance of integrity and function of basement membranes under conditions of increasing mechanical demands, but dispensable for deposition and initial assembly of components. Taken together with other basement membrane protein knockouts, these data suggest that laminin is sufficient for basement membrane-like matrices during early development, but at later stages the specific composition of components including collagen IV defines integrity, stability and functionality."</span>

This review deals with some of these rules and in particular those concerning the crucial role of the neurotransmitter γ-aminobuytric acid (GABA), which operates primarily via chloride-permeable GABA A receptor channels. In all developing animal species and brain structures investigated, neurons have a higher intracellular chloride concentration at an early stage leading to an efflux of chloride and excitatory actions of GABA in immature neurons. This triggers sodium spikes, activates voltage-gated calcium channels, and acts in synergy with NMDA channels by removing the voltage-dependent magnesium block. GABA signaling is also established before glutamatergic transmission, suggesting that GABA is the principal excitatory transmitter during early development. In fact, even before synapse formation, GABA signaling can modulate the cell cycle and migration. The consequence of these rules is that developing networks generate primitive patterns of network activity, notably the giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs), largely through the excitatory actions of GABA and its synergistic interactions with glutamate signaling. These early types of network activity are likely required for neurons to fire together and thus to “wire together” so that functional units within cortical networks are formed. In addition, depolarizing GABA has a strong impact on synaptic plasticity and pathological insults, notably seizures of the immature brain. In conclusion, it is suggested that an evolutionary preserved role for excitatory GABA in immature cells provides an important mechanism in the formation of synapses and activity in neuronal networks."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The mdr1-type P-glycoproteins (P-gps) confer multidrug resistance to cancer cells by active extrusion of a wide range of drugs from the cell. To study their physiological roles, we have generated mice genetically deficient in the mdr1b gene [ mdr1b (−/−) mice] and in both the mdr1a and mdr1b genes [ mdr1a/1b (−/−) mice]. In spite of the host of functions speculatively attributed to the mdr1-type P-gps, we found no physiological abnormalities in either strain. Viability, fertility, and a range of histological, hematological, serum–chemical, and immunological parameters were not abnormal in mdr1a/1b (−/−) mice. The high level of mdr1b P-gp normally present in the pregnant uterus did not protect fetuses from a drug (digoxin) in the bloodstream of the mother, although the protein did reduce drug accumulation in the adrenal gland and ovaries. Pharmacologically, mdr1a/1b (−/−) mice behaved similarly to the previously analyzed mdr1a (−/−) mice, displaying, for instance, increased brain penetration and reduced elimination of digoxin. However, both mdr1a and mdr1b P-gps contributed to the extrusion of rhodamine from hematopoietic progenitor cells, suggesting a potential role for the endogenous mdr1-type P-gps in protection of bone marrow against cytotoxic anticancer drugs. This, and the normal viability of mdr1a/1b (−/−) mice, has implications for the use of P-gp-blocking agents in cancer and other chemotherapy. mdr1a/1b (−/−) mice should provide a useful model system to further test the pharmacological roles of the drug-transporting P-gps and to analyze the specificity and effectivity of P-gp-blocking drugs."</span>

Mice that are genetically deficient in both the Mdr1a and Mdr1b genes, which together seem to fulfill the same functions as the single human MDR1 gene, show similar increases in brain penetration of drugs to mice that are deficient in Mdr1a alone, which indicates that Pgp in the BBB is predominantly encoded by Mdr1a in rodents.
This study reports the generation and characterization of mice lacking both Mdr1a and Mdr1b, revealing a lack of overt physiological abnormalities but highlighting a role for these transporters in protecting hematopoietic progenitor cells.

To counteract this mechanism, many pathogens have evolved to evade, subvert, or exploit autophagy. Here, we report that autophagy proteins (i.e., Beclin-1, Atg4B, Atg5, and Atg12) are proviral factors required for translation of incoming hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA and, thereby, for initiation of HCV replication, but they are not required once infection is established.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"▪ Abstract Many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (prion diseases), are characterized at autopsy by neuronal loss and protein aggregates that are typically fibrillar. A convergence of evidence strongly suggests that protein aggregation is neurotoxic and not a product of cell death. However, the identity of the neurotoxic aggregate and the mechanism by which it disables and eventually kills a neuron are unknown. Both biophysical studies aimed at elucidating the precise mechanism of in vitro aggregation and animal modeling studies support the emerging notion that an ordered prefibrillar oligomer, or protofibril, may be responsible for cell death and that the fibrillar form that is typically observed at autopsy may actually be neuroprotective. A subpopulation of protofibrils may function as pathogenic amyloid pores. An analogous mechanism may explain the neurotoxicity of the prion protein; recent data demonstrates that the disease-associated, infectious form of the prion protein differs from the neurotoxic species. This review focuses on recent experimental studies aimed at identification and characterization of the neurotoxic protein aggregates."</span>

Here, we report that a targeted deletion of PPARγ in mice results in the production of “toxic milk” containing elevated levels of inflammatory lipids. Surprisingly, ingestion of this “toxic milk” causes inflammation, alopecia, and growth retardation in the nursing neonates.

Here, we study the impact of interactions between coinfecting opportunistic pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa on both phenotypic and genetic changes in a P. aeruginosa social trait, the production of iron-scavenging siderophores. Siderophores are facultatively upregulated in response to iron limitation and play a key role in determining the virulence of microbial infections. Siderophore production is metabolically expensive to individual producers but benefits the group as a whole because siderophores can be used by all cells in the vicinity with siderophore receptors. Hence, populations of siderophore producers can be invaded by nonproducing cheats. Previous work has shown that P. aeruginosa can lyse S. aureus, supplying a source of free iron. We therefore hypothesized that the presence of S. aureus might result in facultative downregulation of siderophore production, and in turn, reduced selection for siderophore cheats. We tested this hypothesis by evolving P. aeruginosa in the presence and absence of free iron and S. aureus, in a fully factorial design. Iron had the expected effect: siderophore production was downregulated and cheats evolved less readily, but the presence of S. aureus instead increased facultative siderophore production and selection for cheats. This is probably because the S. aureus had the net effect of competing for iron, rather than acting as an iron source. This study demonstrates that interspecific competition can have a marked effect on intraspecific social interactions."</span>

Using sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, we have isolated low-density, Triton X-100-insoluble membrane domains from RBL-2H3 mucosal mast cells that contain several markers common to caveolae, including a src-family tyrosine kinase, p53/56lyn. Aggregation of Fc epsilon RI, the high-affinity IgE receptor, causes a significant increase in the amount of p53/56lyn associated with these low-density membrane domains. Under our standard conditions for lysis, IgE-Fc epsilon RI fractionates with the majority of the solubilized proteins, whereas aggregated receptor complexes are found at a higher density in the gradient. Stimulated translocation of p53/56lyn is accompanied by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in the low-density membrane domains as well as enhanced in vitro tyrosine kinase activity toward these proteins and an exogenous substrate. With a lower detergent-to-cell ratio during lysis, significant Fc epsilon RI remains associated with these membrane domains, consistent with the ability to coimmunoprecipitate tyrosine kinase activity with Fc epsilon RI under similar lysis conditions [Pribluda, V.

Ultrasound-evoked gating of hs TRPA1 specifically requires its N-terminal tip region and cholesterol interactions; and target cells with an intact actin cytoskeleton, revealing elements of the sonogenetic mechanism. Next, we use calcium imaging and electrophysiology to show that hs TRPA1 potentiates ultrasound-evoked responses in primary neurons. Furthermore, unilateral expression of hs TRPA1 in mouse layer V motor cortical neurons leads to c-fos expression and contralateral limb responses in response to ultrasound delivered through an intact skull.

A unique mechanism called store-operated calcium entry is activated when ER calcium is depleted, serving to restore intra-ER calcium levels. An ER calcium sensor, stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), translocates within the ER membrane upon store depletion to the juxtaplasma membrane domain, where it interacts with intracellular domains of a highly calcium-selective plasma membrane ion channel, Orai1. STIM1 gates Orai1, allowing calcium to enter the cytoplasm, where it repletes the ER store via calcium-ATPases pumps. Here, we performed affinity purification of Orai1 from Jurkat cells to identify partner of STIM1 (POST), a 10-transmembrane–spanning segment protein of unknown function. The protein is located in the plasma membrane and ER. POST-Orai1 binding is store depletion-independent. On store depletion, the protein binds STIM1 and moves within the ER to localize near the cell membrane. This protein, TMEM20 (POST), does not affect store-operated calcium entry but does reduce plasma membrane Ca 2+ pump activity. Store depletion promotes STIM1–POST complex binding to smooth ER and plasma membrane Ca 2+ ATPases (SERCAs and PMCAs, respectively), Na/K-ATPase, as well as to the nuclear transporters, importins-β and exportins."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"A large number of cancer-associated gene products evoke immune recognition, but host reactions rarely impede disease progression. The weak immunogenicity of nascent tumors contributes to this failure in host defense. Therapeutic vaccines that enhance dendritic cell presentation of cancer antigens increase specific cellular and humoral responses, thereby effectuating tumor destruction in some cases. The attenuation of T cell activation by cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) further limits the potency of tumor immunity. In murine systems, the administration of antibodies that block CTLA-4 function inhibits the growth of moderately immunogenic tumors and, in combination with cancer vaccines, increases the rejection of poorly immunogenic tumors, albeit with a loss of tolerance to normal differentiation antigens. To gain a preliminary assessment of the biologic activity of antagonizing CTLA-4 function in humans, we infused a CTLA-4 blocking antibody (MDX-CTLA4) into nine previously immunized advanced cancer patients. MDX-CTLA4 stimulated extensive tumor necrosis with lymphocyte and granulocyte infiltrates in three of three metastatic melanoma patients and the reduction or stabilization of CA-125 levels in two of two metastatic ovarian carcinoma patients previously vaccinated with irradiated, autologous granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor-secreting tumor cells. MDX-CTLA4 did not elicit tumor necrosis in four of four metastatic melanoma patients previously immunized with defined melanosomal antigens.

The molecular basis for this clinically important phenomenon is poorly understood, hampered by the instability of the SCV phenotype. Here we investigated the genetic basis for an unstable S. aureus SCV that arose spontaneously while studying rifampicin resistance. This SCV showed no nucleotide differences across its genome compared with a normal-colony variant (NCV) revertant, yet the SCV presented the hallmarks of S. aureus linked to persistent infection: down-regulation of virulence genes and reduced hemolysis and neutrophil chemotaxis, while exhibiting increased survival in blood and ability to invade host cells. Further genome analysis revealed chromosome structural variation uniquely associated with the SCV. These variations included an asymmetric inversion across half of the S. aureus chromosome via recombination between type I restriction modification system (T1RMS) genes, and the activation of a conserved prophage harboring the immune evasion cluster (IEC). Phenotypic reversion to the wild-type–like NCV state correlated with reversal of the chromosomal inversion (CI) and with prophage stabilization. Further analysis of 29 complete S. aureus genomes showed strong signatures of recombination between hsdMS genes, suggesting that analogous CI has repeatedly occurred during S. aureus evolution. Using qPCR and long-read amplicon deep sequencing, we detected subpopulations with T1RMS rearrangements causing CIs and prophage activation across major S. aureus lineages.

We previously reported that human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons co-expressed TRPV1 and TRPV3, and that these were increased in injured human DRG. Related receptors TRPV4, activated by warmth and eicosanoids, and TRPM8, activated by cool and menthol, have been characterised in pre-clinical models. However, the role of TRPs in common clinical sensory neuropathies needs to be established. Methods We have studied TRPV1, TRPV3, TRPV4, and TRPM8 in nerves (n = 14) and skin from patients with nerve injury, avulsed dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (n = 11), injured spinal nerve roots (n = 9), diabetic neuropathy skin (n = 8), non-diabetic neuropathic nerve biopsies (n = 6), their respective control tissues, and human post mortem spinal cord, using immunohistological methods. Results TRPV1 and TRPV3 were significantly increased in injured brachial plexus nerves, and TRPV1 in hypersensitive skin after nerve repair, whilst TRPV4 was unchanged. TRPM8 was detected in a few medium diameter DRG neurons, and was unchanged in DRG after avulsion injury, but was reduced in axons and myelin in injured nerves. In diabetic neuropathy skin, TRPV1 expressing sub- and intra-epidermal fibres were decreased, as was expression in surviving fibres. TRPV1 was also decreased in non-diabetic neuropathic nerves. Immunoreactivity for TRPV3 was detected in basal keratinocytes, with a significant decrease of TRPV3 in diabetic skin. TRPV1-immunoreactive nerves were present in injured dorsal spinal roots and dorsal horn of control spinal cord, but not in ventral roots, while TRPV3 and TRPV4 were detected in spinal cord motor neurons. Conclusion The accumulation of TRPV1 and TRPV3 in peripheral nerves after injury, in spared axons, matches our previously reported changes in avulsed DRG. Reduction of TRPV1 levels in nerve fibres in diabetic neuropathy skin may result from the known decrease of nerve growth factor (NGF) levels. The role of TRPs in keratinocytes is unknown, but a relationship to changes in NGF levels, which is produced by keratinocytes, deserves investigation. TRPV1 represents a more selective therapeutic target than other TRPs for pain and hypersensitivity, particularly in post-traumatic neuropathy."</span>

These distinct behaviors and functional specificity are generated by variations in the enzymatic domain as well as the non‐conserved regions outside of the kinesin motor domain and the stalk.

The mechanisms underlying the sorting of membrane into the different populations of intraluminal vesicles are unknown. Here, we find that cargo is segregated into distinct subdomains on the endosomal membrane and that the transfer of exosome-associated domains into the lumen of the endosome did not depend on the function of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery, but required the sphingolipid ceramide. Purified exosomes were enriched in ceramide, and the release of exosomes was reduced after the inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinases. These results establish a pathway in intraendosomal membrane transport and exosome formation."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Damaged mitochondria are selectively eliminated in a process called mitophagy. Parkin and PINK1, proteins mutated in Parkinson’s disease, amplify ubiquitin signals on damaged mitochondria with the subsequent activation of autophagic machinery. Autophagy adaptors are thought to link ubiquitinated mitochondria and autophagy through ATG8 protein binding. Here, we establish methods for inducing mitophagy by mitochondria-targeted ubiquitin chains and chemical-induced mitochondrial ubiquitination. Using these tools, we reveal that the ubiquitin signal is sufficient for mitophagy and that PINK1 and Parkin are unnecessary for autophagy activation per se. Furthermore, using phase-separated fluorescent foci, we show that the critical autophagy adaptor OPTN forms a complex with ATG9A vesicles. Disruption of OPTN–ATG9A interactions does not induce mitophagy. Therefore, in addition to binding ATG8 proteins, the critical autophagy adaptors also bind the autophagy core units that contribute to the formation of multivalent interactions in the de novo synthesis of autophagosomal membranes near ubiquitinated mitochondria."</span>

In this study, a tracking microscope is used to record the three-dimensional motion of Escherichia coli near a planar glass surface. Data from the tracking microscope are analyzed to quantify the effects of bacteria-surface interactions on the swimming behavior of bacteria.

Lopes, R.P. Markus, T. Pozzan, and C.R. Garcia. 2000. Nat. Cell Biol. 2:466–468). Here we show that in Plasmodium falciparum melatonin induces an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity (40 and 50%, respectively). When red blood cells infected with P. falciparum are treated with cAMP analogue adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate N6-benzoyl/PKA activator (6-Bz-cAMP) there is an alteration of the parasite cell cycle. This effect appears to depend on activation of PKA (abolished by the PKA inhibitors adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate/8 Bromo Rp isomer, PKI [cell permeable peptide], and H89). An unexpected cross talk was found to exist between the cAMP and the Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways. The increases in cAMP by melatonin are inhibited by blocker of phospholipase C U73122, and addition of 6-Bz-cAMP increases cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, through PKA activation. These findings suggest that in Plasmodium a highly complex interplay exists between the Ca2+ and cAMP signaling pathways, but also that the control of the parasite cell cycle by melatonin requires the activation of both second messenger controlled pathways."</span>

In yeast, replicative leading- and lagging-strand DNA polymerases (Pols ε and δ, respectively) have intrinsic proofreading exonucleases that cooperate with each other and mismatch repair to limit spontaneous mutation to less than 1 per genome per cell division. The relationship of these pathways in mammals and their functions in vivo are unknown. Here we show that mouse Pol ε and δ proofreading suppress discrete mutator and cancer phenotypes. We found that inactivation of Pol ε proofreading elevates base-substitution mutations and accelerates a unique spectrum of spontaneous cancers; the types of tumors are entirely different from those triggered by loss of Pol δ proofreading. Intercrosses of Pol ε-, Pol δ-, and mismatch repair-mutant mice show that Pol ε and δ proofreading act in parallel pathways to prevent spontaneous mutation and cancer.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Midzone microtubules of mammalian cells play an essential role in the induction of cell cleavage, serving as a platform for a number of proteins that play a part in cytokinesis. We demonstrate that PRC1, a mitotic spindle-associated Cdk substrate that is essential to cell cleavage, is a microtubule binding and bundling protein both in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of PRC1 extensively bundles interphase microtubules, but does not affect early mitotic spindle organization. PRC1 contains two Cdk phosphorylation motifs, and phosphorylation is possibly important to mitotic suppression of bundling, as a Cdk phosphorylation-null mutant causes extensive bundling of the prometaphase spindle. Complete suppression of PRC1 by siRNA causes failure of microtubule interdigitation between half spindles and the absence of a spindle midzone. Truncation mutants demonstrate that the NH2-terminal region of PRC1, rich in α-helical sequence, is important for localization to the cleavage furrow and to the center of the midbody, whereas the central region, with the highest sequence homology between species, is required for microtubule binding and bundling activity. We conclude that PRC1 is a microtubule-associated protein required to maintain the spindle midzone, and that distinct functions are associated with modular elements of the primary sequence."</span>

Here, we analyzed the Vβ8.1 TCR repertoire directly ex vivo by complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) length spectratyping throughout the acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, into memory, and under conditions of T cell clonal exhaustion. The Vβ8 population represented 30–35% of the LCMV-induced CD8+ T cells and included T cells recognizing several LCMV-encoded peptides, allowing for a comprehensive study of a multiclonal T cell response against a complex antigen. Genetically identical mice generated remarkably different T cell responses, as reflected by different spectratypes and different TCR sequences in same sized spectratype bands; however, a conserved CDR3 motif was found within some same sized bands. This indicated that meaningful studies on the evolution of the T cell repertoire required longitudinal studies within individual mice. Such longitudinal studies with peripheral blood lymphocyte samples showed that (a) the virus-induced T cell repertoire changes little during the apoptosis period after clearance of the viral antigens; (b) the LCMV infection dramatically skews the host T cell repertoire in the memory state; and (c) continuous selection of the T cell repertoire occurs under conditions of persistent infections."</span>

How visual signals related to such unseen stimuli access the amygdala is unknown. A possible pathway, involving the superior colliculus and pulvinar, is suggested by observations of patients with striate cortex lesions who show preserved abilities to localize and discriminate visual stimuli that are not consciously perceived (“blindsight”). We used measures of right amygdala neural activity acquired from volunteer subjects viewing masked fear-conditioned faces to determine whether a colliculo-pulvinar pathway was engaged during processing of these unseen target stimuli. Increased connectivity between right amygdala, pulvinar, and superior colliculus was evident when fear-conditioned faces were unseen rather than seen. Right amygdala connectivity with fusiform and orbitofrontal cortices decreased in the same condition. By contrast, the left amygdala, whose activity did not discriminate seen and unseen fear-conditioned targets, showed no masking-dependent changes in connectivity with superior colliculus or pulvinar.

We identified substantial biases for seven landscape attributes in one or more regions across the conterminous United States. Streams with small watersheds (&lt;10 km 2 ) and at high elevations were often underrepresented, and biases were greater for water temperature gages and in arid regions.

We have identified and characterized an atypical Hfq required for gene regulation and infectivity in the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi . Sequence analyses of the putative B. burgdorferi Hfq protein revealed only a modest level of similarity with the Hfq from Escherichia coli , although a few key residues are retained and the predicted tertiary structure is similar. Several lines of evidence suggest that the B. burgdorferi bb0268 gene encodes a functional Hfq homologue. First, the hfq Bb gene ( bb0268 ) restores the efficient translation of an rpoS :: lacZ fusion in an E. coli hfq null mutant. Second, the Hfq from B. burgdorferi binds to the small RNA DsrA Bb and the rpoS mRNA. Third, a B. burgdorferi hfq null mutant was generated and has a pleiotropic phenotype that includes increased cell length and decreased growth rate, as found in hfq mutants in other bacteria. The hfq Bb mutant phenotype is complemented in trans with the hfq gene from either B. burgdorferi or, surprisingly, E. coli . This is the first example of a heterologous bacterial gene complementing a B. burgdorferi mutant. The alternative sigma factor RpoS and the outer membrane lipoprotein OspC, which are induced by increased temperature and required for mammalian infection, are not upregulated in the hfq mutant. Consequently, the hfq mutant is not infectious by needle inoculation in the murine model.

A unique feature of B‐class ephrins and Eph receptors is their ability to transmit bidirectional signals in both ephrin‐ and Eph receptor‐expressing cells upon cell–cell contact. These signals can lead to cytoskeletal alterations that have been attributed to regulating neuronal growth responses. Examination of gene‐target knockout mice has supported this hypothesis, revealing numerous developmental defects in the nervous systems of mice mutant for both B‐class ephrins and Eph receptors. To examine the potential scope of action for these genes in the nervous system, we have used in situ hybridization to study the mRNA expression of ephrins (B1, B2, and B3) and Eph receptors (B1, B2, B3, A4) in neonatal and adult mice.

In addition to their role in pregnancy, IDO-expressing cells are widely distributed in primary and secondary lymphoid organs. Here we show that monocytes that have differentiated under the influence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor acquire the ability to suppress T cell proliferation in vitro via rapid and selective degradation of tryptophan by IDO. IDO was induced in macrophages by a synergistic combination of the T cell–derived signals IFN-γ and CD40-ligand. Inhibition of IDO with the 1-methyl analogue of tryptophan prevented macrophage-mediated suppression. Purified T cells activated under tryptophan-deficient conditions were able to synthesize protein, enter the cell cycle, and progress normally through the initial stages of G1, including upregulation of IL-2 receptor and synthesis of IL-2. However, in the absence of tryptophan, cell cycle progression halted at a mid-G1 arrest point. Restoration of tryptophan to arrested cells was not sufficient to allow further cell cycle progression nor was costimulation via CD28. T cells could exit the arrested state only if a second round of T cell receptor signaling was provided in the presence of tryptophan. These data reveal a novel mechanism by which antigen-presenting cells can regulate T cell activation via tryptophan catabolism. We speculate that expression of IDO by certain antigen presenting cells in vivo allows them to suppress unwanted T cell responses."</span>

We demonstrate that proximal axonal polarity as well as assembly of the AIS and normal morphogenesis of nodes of Ranvier all require a heretofore uncharacterized alternatively spliced giant exon of ankyrin-G (AnkG). This exon has sequence similarity to I-connectin/Titin and was acquired after the first round of whole-genome duplication by the ancestral ANK2/ANK3 gene in early vertebrates before development of myelin. The giant exon resulted in a new nervous system-specific 480-kDa polypeptide combining previously known features of ANK repeats and β-spectrin–binding activity with a fibrous domain nearly 150 nm in length. We elucidate previously undescribed functions for giant AnkG, including recruitment of β4 spectrin to the AIS that likely is regulated by phosphorylation, and demonstrate that 480-kDa AnkG is a major component of the AIS membrane “undercoat’ imaged by platinum replica electron microscopy. Surprisingly, giant AnkG-knockout neurons completely lacking known AIS components still retain distal axonal polarity and generate action potentials (APs), although with abnormal frequency. Giant AnkG-deficient mice live to weaning and provide a rationale for survival of humans with severe cognitive dysfunction bearing a truncating mutation in the giant exon.

However, the function of Bcl-2 at the level of the ER is poorly understood. In this study, we have investigated the effects of Bcl-2 expression on Ca 2+ storage and release by the ER. The expression of Bcl-2 decreased the amount of Ca 2+ that could be released from intracellular stores, regardless of the mode of store depletion, the cell type, or the species from which Bcl-2 was derived. Bcl-2 also decreased cellular Ca 2+ store content in the presence of mitochondrial inhibitors, suggesting that its effects were not mediated through mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake. Direct measurements with ER-targeted Ca 2+ -sensitive fluorescent “cameleon” proteins revealed that Bcl-2 decreased the free Ca 2+ concentration within the lumen of the ER, [Ca 2+ ] ER . Analysis of the kinetics of Ca 2+ store depletion in response to the Ca 2+ -ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin revealed that Bcl-2 increased the permeability of the ER membrane. These results suggest that Bcl-2 decreases the free Ca 2+ concentration within the ER lumen by increasing the Ca 2+ permeability of the ER membrane.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Gastrointestinal infections often induce epithelial damage that must be repaired for optimal gut function. While intestinal stem cells are critical for this regeneration process [R. C. van der Wath, B. S. Gardiner, A. W. Burgess, D. W. Smith, PLoS One 8, e73204 (2013); S. Kozar et al. , Cell Stem Cell 13, 626–633 (2013)], how they are impacted by enteric infections remains poorly defined. Here, we investigate infection-mediated damage to the colonic stem cell compartment and how this affects epithelial repair and recovery from infection. Using the pathogen Clostridioides difficile, we show that infection disrupts murine intestinal cellular organization and integrity deep into the epithelium, to expose the otherwise protected stem cell compartment, in a TcdB-mediated process. Exposure and susceptibility of colonic stem cells to intoxication compromises their function during infection, which diminishes their ability to repair the injured epithelium, shown by altered stem cell signaling and a reduction in the growth of colonic organoids from stem cells isolated from infected mice. We also show, using both mouse and human colonic organoids, that TcdB from epidemic ribotype 027 strains does not require Frizzled 1/2/7 binding to elicit this dysfunctional stem cell state. This stem cell dysfunction induces a significant delay in recovery and repair of the intestinal epithelium of up to 2 wk post the infection peak. Our results uncover a mechanism by which an enteric pathogen subverts repair processes by targeting stem cells during infection and preventing epithelial regeneration, which prolongs epithelial barrier impairment and creates an environment in which disease recurrence is likely."</span>

These bacteria have up to five of these systems, termed ESX ‐1 to ESX ‐5. Here, we show that ESX ‐5 of M ycobacterium tuberculosis mediates the secretion of EsxN , PPE and PE_PGRS proteins, indicating that ESX ‐5 is a major secretion pathway in this important pathogen. Using the ESX ‐5 system of M ycobacterium marinum and M ycobacterium bovis BCG as a model, we have purified and analysed the T7S membrane complex under native conditions. blue native‐ PAGE and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the ESX ‐5 membrane complex of both species has a size of ∼ 1500 kDa and is composed of four conserved membrane proteins, i.e. EccB 5 , EccC 5 , EccD 5 and EccE 5 . Subsequent limited proteolysis suggests that EccC 5 and EccE 5 mostly reside on the periphery of the complex. We also observed that EccC 5 and EccD 5 expression is essential for the formation of a stable membrane complex. These are the first data on a T7S membrane complex and, given the high conservation of its components, our data can likely be generalized to most mycobacterial T7S systems."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The physiological processes of natural phytoplankton mortality due to environmental stress (vs. that caused by sedimentation and predation) are poorly understood. Cell survival was examined in batch cultures of the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii and the chlorophyte Dunaliella tertiolecta during deprivation of fixed nitrogen or light. Despite severe impairment of photosynthetic efficiencies, both species remained viable during 2 weeks of N starvation. Under N stress, a specific protease was induced in the diatom, overall activity of proteases doubled, and there was gradual, selective loss of certain proteins, especially ribulose 1,5‐bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. Light‐deprived diatoms were virtually unaffected, but the chlorophyte underwent catastrophic cell death after about 6 d of darkness. Cell death coincided with a large increase in protease activity and the induction of a specific protease. Although we cannot completely rule out roles for viruses or bacteria in the losses of cells, the consistent timing, the unique response to stress, and the coincident expression of a specific protease strongly suggest that the process is a form of autocatalyzed cell death, such as apoptosis. While of uncertain adaptive significance, phytoplankton cell death may have implications for species succession and cycling of organic matter in aquatic ecosysterns."</span>

DNAs, RNAs and their synthetic analogues, either unmodified or labeled with electroactive markers, have been analyzed by adsorptive stripping (AdS) techniques with mercury, mercury film, amalgam and carbon-based electrodes. Strong adsorption of NAs at the electrode surfaces has been utilized in adsorptive transfer stripping (AdTS) techniques. In AdTS, a NA-modified electrode is prepared by adsorptive accumulation of the NA at the electrode surface, followed by transfer into background electrolyte not containing any NA.

Here, we show that FGF21 activity depends on βKlotho, a single-pass transmembrane protein whose expression is induced during differentiation from preadipocytes to adipocytes. βKlotho physically interacts with FGF receptors 1c and 4, thereby increasing the ability of these FGF receptors to bind FGF21 and activate the MAP kinase cascade. Knockdown of βKlotho expression by siRNA in adipocytes diminishes glucose uptake induced by FGF21.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Phagocytosis is a principal component of the body’s innate immunity in which macrophages internalize targets in an actin-dependent manner. Targets vary widely in shape and size and include particles such as pathogens and senescent cells. Despite considerable progress in understanding this complicated process, the role of target geometry in phagocytosis has remained elusive. Previous studies on phagocytosis have been performed using spherical targets, thereby overlooking the role of particle shape. Using polystyrene particles of various sizes and shapes, we studied phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages. We report a surprising finding that particle shape, not size, plays a dominant role in phagocytosis. All shapes were capable of initiating phagocytosis in at least one orientation. However, the local particle shape, measured by tangent angles, at the point of initial contact dictates whether macrophages initiate phagocytosis or simply spread on particles. The local shape determines the complexity of the actin structure that must be created to initiate phagocytosis and allow the membrane to move over the particle. Failure to create the required actin structure results in simple spreading and not internalization. Particle size primarily impacts the completion of phagocytosis in cases where particle volume exceeds the cell volume."</span>

However, clinical recommendations on how to identify, characterize and treat clinical depression are lacking. To address this gap, an expert panel was convened to systematically review the published literature and develop guidelines on the evaluation and management of perimenopausal depression. The areas addressed included: 1) epidemiology; 2) clinical presentation; 3) therapeutic effects of antidepressants; 4) effects of hormone therapy; and 5) efficacy of other therapies (eg, psychotherapy, exercise, and natural health products). Overall, evidence generally suggests that most midlife women who experience a major depressive episode during the perimenopause have experienced a prior episode of depression. Midlife depression presents with classic depressive symptoms commonly in combination with menopause symptoms (ie, vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbance), and psychosocial challenges. Menopause symptoms complicate, co-occur, and overlap with the presentation of depression. Diagnosis involves identification of menopausal stage, assessment of co-occurring psychiatric and menopause symptoms, appreciation of the psychosocial factors common in midlife, differential diagnoses, and the use of validated screening instruments. Proven therapeutic options for depression (ie, antidepressants, psychotherapy) are the front-line treatments for perimenopausal depression. Although estrogen therapy is not approved to treat perimenopausal depression, there is evidence that it has antidepressant effects in perimenopausal women, particularly those with concomitant vasomotor symptoms. Data on estrogen plus progestin are sparse and inconclusive."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Autophagy is an essential cellular mechanism for cell homeostasis and survival by which damaged cellular proteins are sequestered in autophagosomal vesicles and cleared through lysosomal machinery. The autophagy pathway also plays an important role in immunity and inflammation via pathogen clearance mechanisms mediated by immune cells, including macrophages and neutrophils. In particular, recent studies have revealed that autophagic activity is required for the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), representing a distinct form of active neutrophil death, namely NETosis. Although NET formation is beneficial during host defense against invading pathogens, the mechanisms that promote excessive NETosis under pathological conditions remain ill defined. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the role of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in NETosis. As mTOR kinase is known as a key regulator of autophagy in many mammalian cells including neutrophils, we hypothesized that mTOR may play a regulatory role in NET release by regulating autophagic activity. Our data show that the pharmacological inhibition of the mTOR pathway accelerated the rate of NET release following neutrophil stimulation with the bacteria-derived peptide formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), while autophagosome formation was enhanced by mTOR inhibitors. This increased mTOR-dependent NET release was sensitive to inhibition of respiratory burst or blockade of cytoskeletal dynamics. Overall, this study demonstrates a pivotal role for the mTOR pathway in coordinating intracellular signaling events downstream of neutrophil activation leading to NETosis."</span>

In addition to the efficiency, the materials used for transporting charges must be resilient to light, heat, and moisture to ensure long‐term stability of PSCs; furthermore, low‐cost fabrication is required to form a charge transport layer at low temperatures by a solution process. For this purpose, metal oxides are best suited as charge transport materials for PSCs because of their advantages such as low cost, long‐term stability, and high efficiency.

We then use this resource to train a multi-scale model that integrates four omics layers to predict genome-wide concentrations and growth dynamics. The genetic and environmental ontology reconstructed from the omics data is substantially different and complementary to the genetic and chemical ontologies. The integration of different layers confers an incremental increase in the prediction performance, as does the information about the known gene regulatory and protein-protein interactions.

We have developed a reporter technology based on the differential induction of Escherichia coli TEM-1 β-lactamase (Bla) enzymatic activity that can function as a sensor of the interaction state of two target proteins within single neurons in vivo . To modulate Bla enzymatic activity, we first split the enzyme into two separate, complementary protein fragments that we identified by using a functional screening approach based on circular permutation of the Bla enzyme. The split enzyme was then brought together by the phosphorylation-dependent association of the kinase inducible domain of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and the KIX domain of the CREB binding protein. Using an intracellular substrate whose fluorescence spectrum changes after hydrolysis by Bla, we performed time-lapse ratiometric imaging measurements of Bla enzymatic induction after association of the CREB and CREB binding protein interaction domains.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"▪ Abstract It has been clear for almost two decades that cortical representations in adult animals are not fixed entities, but rather, are dynamic and are continuously modified by experience. The cortex can preferentially allocate area to represent the particular peripheral input sources that are proportionally most used. Alterations in cortical representations appear to underlie learning tasks dependent on the use of the behaviorally important peripheral inputs that they represent. The rules governing this cortical representational plasticity following manipulations of inputs, including learning, are increasingly well understood. In parallel with developments in the field of cortical map plasticity, studies of synaptic plasticity have characterized specific elementary forms of plasticity, including associative long-term potentiation and long-term depression of excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Investigators have made many important strides toward understanding the molecular underpinnings of these fundamental plasticity processes and toward defining the learning rules that govern their induction. The fields of cortical synaptic plasticity and cortical map plasticity have been implicitly linked by the hypothesis that synaptic plasticity underlies cortical map reorganization. Recent experimental and theoretical work has provided increasingly stronger support for this hypothesis. The goal of the current paper is to review the fields of both synaptic and cortical map plasticity with an emphasis on the work that attempts to unite both fields. A second objective is to highlight the gaps in our understanding of synaptic and cellular mechanisms underlying cortical representational plasticity."</span>

HKa (cleaved high molecular weight kininogen) is an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis formed by the cleavage of kininogen on endothelial cells. Ferritin is a protein principally known for its central role in iron storage. Here, we demonstrate that ferritin binds to HKa with high affinity ( K d 13 nM). Further, ferritin antagonizes the antiangiogenic effects of HKa, enhancing the migration, assembly, and survival of HKa-treated endothelial cells. Effects of ferritin were independent of its iron content. Peptide mapping revealed that ferritin binds to a 22-aa subdomain of HKa that is critical to its antiangiogenic activity.

The role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on the pattern generation properties of neuronal ensembles in the olivocerebellar system was studied utilizing multiple electrode recordings of complex spikes (CSs) from rat crus 2a Purkinje cells (PCs). Initially multiple electrode experiments were combined with microinjections of picrotoxin into the inferior olive (IO). To corroborate the picrotoxin findings, the cerebellar nuclei, a major source of the GABAergic terminals in the IO, were chemically lesioned with the use of microinjections of kainic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate. Both procedures generated comparable results. 2. After intraolivary picrotoxin injection there was an increase in the average firing rate, synchrony, and rhythmicity of spontaneous CS activity. In addition, the neuronal oscillation frequency tended to shift to lower frequencies. 3. The spatial distribution of synchronous CS activity in control conditions displayed a predominantly rostrocaudal orientation. Injection of picrotoxin to the IO disrupted this rostrocaudal organization and led to synchronous CS activity among PCs throughout crus 2a. Similar effects were observed relating to the distribution of CSs evoked via the "climbing fiber reflex," in which antidromic activation of the climbing fibers is followed by a return excitation that is mediated by the gap junctions between olivary neurons. 4. Chemical lesions of the cerebellar nuclei resulted in increased CS average firing rates. The effect of the lesions on CS synchronicity was similar to that following the picrotoxin injections, but greater in magnitude. In contrast to the olivary picrotoxin injections, the cerebellar nuclear lesions did not lead to an enhanced CS rhythmicity. 5. Bilateral recordings from left and right crus 2a demonstrated significant interhemispheric synchronization of CS activity, consistent with a previous report. Both unilateral olivary injections of picrotoxin and unilateral cerebellar nuclear lesions resulted in increased synchronization of CS activity between the left and right crus 2a. 6. We conclude that the cerebellar nucleoolivary projection to the olivary glomeruli modulates the effective electrotonic coupling between olivary neurons, and thereby carves out ensembles of neurons whose activity is synchronized. Thus these two nuclei may form the basis for a flexible and sophisticated motor coordination system able to help generate the many distinct movements that organisms are capable of performing."</span>

In contrast to the studies on DWNT5 (WNT5) in the fly, WNT4 acts as an attractive guidance molecule.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The tight regulation of splicing networks is critical for organismal development. To maintain robust splicing patterns, many splicing factors autoregulate their expression through alternative splicing-coupled nonsense-mediated decay (AS-NMD). However, as negative autoregulation results in a self-limiting window of splicing factor expression, it is unknown how variations in steady-state protein levels can arise in different physiological contexts. Here, we demonstrate that Rbfox2 cross-regulates AS-NMD events within RNA-binding proteins to alter their expression. Using individual nucleotide-resolution cross-linking immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing (iCLIP) and mRNA sequencing, we identified &gt;200 AS-NMD splicing events that are bound by Rbfox2 in mouse embryonic stem cells. These “silent” events are characterized by minimal apparent splicing changes but appreciable changes in gene expression upon Rbfox2 knockdown due to degradation of the NMD-inducing isoform. Nearly 70 of these AS-NMD events fall within genes encoding RNA-binding proteins, many of which are autoregulated. As with the coding splicing events that we found to be regulated by Rbfox2, silent splicing events are evolutionarily conserved and frequently contain the Rbfox2 consensus UGCAUG. Our findings uncover an unexpectedly broad and multilayer regulatory network controlled by Rbfox2 and offer an explanation for how autoregulatory splicing networks are tuned."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Monterey Bay, CA is an Eastern boundary upwelling system that is nitrogen limited much of the year. In order to resolve population dynamics of microorganisms important for nutrient cycling in this region, we deployed the Environmental Sample Processor with quantitative PCR assays targeting both ribosomal RNA genes and functional genes for subclades of cyanobacteria (Synechococcus) and ammonia-oxidizing Archaea (Thaumarchaeota) populations. Results showed a strong correlation between Thaumarchaea abundances and nitrate during the spring upwelling but not the fall sampling period. In relatively stratified fall waters, the Thaumarchaeota community reached higher numbers than in the spring, and an unexpected positive correlation with chlorophyll concentration was observed. Further, we detected drops in Synechococcus abundance that occurred on short (that is, daily) time scales. Upwelling intensity and blooms of eukaryotic phytoplankton strongly influenced Synechococcus distributions in the spring and fall, revealing what appear to be the environmental limitations of Synechococcus populations in this region. Each of these findings has implications for Monterey Bay biogeochemistry. High-resolution sampling provides a better-resolved framework within which to observe changes in the plankton community. We conclude that controls on these ecosystems change on smaller scales than are routinely assessed, and that more predictable trends will be uncovered if they are evaluated within seasonal (monthly), rather than on annual or interannual scales."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"While long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) and mRNAs share similar biogenesis pathways, these transcript classes differ in many regards. LincRNAs are less evolutionarily conserved, less abundant, and more tissue-specific, suggesting that their pre- and post-transcriptional regulation is different from that of mRNAs. Here, we perform an in-depth characterization of the features that contribute to lincRNA regulation in multiple human cell lines. We find that lincRNA promoters are depleted of transcription factor (TF) binding sites, yet enriched for some specific factors such as GATA and FOS relative to mRNA promoters. Surprisingly, we find that H3K9me3—a histone modification typically associated with transcriptional repression—is more enriched at the promoters of active lincRNA loci than at those of active mRNAs. Moreover, H3K9me3-marked lincRNA genes are more tissue-specific. The most discriminant differences between lincRNAs and mRNAs involve splicing. LincRNAs are less efficiently spliced, which cannot be explained by differences in U1 binding or the density of exonic splicing enhancers but may be partially attributed to lower U2AF65 binding and weaker splicing-related motifs. Conversely, the stability of lincRNAs and mRNAs is similar, differing only with regard to the location of stabilizing protein binding sites. Finally, we find that certain transcriptional properties are correlated with higher evolutionary conservation in both DNA and RNA motifs and are enriched in lincRNAs that have been functionally characterized."</span>

Lipid mediators such as PGE2, which are produced during inflammatory responses, have been shown to suppress MyD88-dependent gene expression upon TLR4 activation in macrophages. The study reported here investigated the effect of PGE2 on TLR3- and TLR4-dependent, MyD88-independent gene expression in murine J774A.1 macrophages, as well as the molecular mechanism underlying such an effect. We demonstrate that PGE2 strongly suppresses LPS-induced IFN-β production at the mRNA and protein levels. Poly (I:C)-induced IFN-β and LPS-induced CCL5 production were also suppressed by PGE2. The inhibitory effect of PGE2 on LPS-induced IFN-β expression is mediated through PGE2 receptor subtypes EP2 and EP4, and mimicked by the cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP as well as by the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin. The downstream effector molecule responsible for the cAMP-induced suppressive effect is exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac) but not protein kinase A. Moreover, data demonstrate that Epac-mediated signaling proceeds through PI3K, Akt, and GSK3β. In contrast, PGE2 inhibits LPS-induced TNF-α production in these cells through a distinct pathway requiring protein kinase A activity and independent of Epac/PI3K/Akt. In vivo, administration of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor before LPS injection resulted in enhanced serum IFN-β concentration in mice. Collectively, data demonstrate that PGE2 is a negative regulator for IFN-β production in activated macrophages and during endotoxemia."</span>

To understand the formation and evolution of these features in a minimal setting, we consider a simple assay: the response of curved surfaces to point indentation. We find that for surfaces with zero or positive Gauss curvature, a common feature of the response is the appearance of faceted structures that are organized in intricate localized patterns, with hysteretic transitions between multiple metastable states. In contrast, for surfaces with negative Gauss curvature the surface deforms nonlocally along characteristic lines that extend through the entire system. These different responses may be understood quantitatively by using numerical simulations and classified qualitatively by using simple geometric ideas.

This animal model allows a low limit of detection and efficient colonization of the chosen bacteria. The animals continuously received tetracycline in drinking water. A tetracycline-sensitive recipient strain was allowed to colonize the animals before the resistant donor was introduced. The numbers of donors, recipients, and transconjugants in fecal samples and intestinal segments were estimated. The bioavailable amounts of tetracycline in fecal samples and intestinal segments were monitored by using bacterial biosensors carrying a transcriptional fusion of a tetracycline-regulated promoter and a lacZ reporter gene. Chromosomal locations of Tn 916 in transconjugants isolated either from the same animal or from different animals were compared by Southern blot analysis. Our results indicated that selection for the resistant phenotype was the major factor causing higher numbers of transconjugants in the presence of tetracycline. Tetracycline-sensitive E. faecalis cells colonized the intestine even when the concentrations of tetracycline in feces and intestinal luminal contents exceeded growth-inhibitory concentrations.

Moreover, pathogenic autoantibodies are typically characterized by a high load of somatic hypermutation and in some cases are highly stable even in the context of prolonged B‐cell depletion. Long‐lived, highly mutated antibodies are typically generated through T‐cell–dependent germinal center ( GC ) reactions. Accordingly, an important role for GC reactions in the generation of pathogenic autoreactivity has been postulated in SLE . Nevertheless, pathogenic autoantibodies and autoimmune disease can be generated through B‐cell extrafollicular ( EF ) reactions in multiple mouse models and human SLE flares are characterized by the expansion of naive‐derived activated effector B cells of extrafollicular phenotype. In this review, we will discuss the properties of the EF B‐cell pathway, its relationship to other effector B‐cell populations, its role in autoimmune diseases, and its contribution to human SLE .

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Phage-mediated metabolic changes in bacteria are hypothesized to markedly alter global nutrient and biogeochemical cycles. Despite their theoretic importance, experimental data on the net metabolic impact of phage infection on the bacterial metabolism remains scarce. In this study, we tracked the dynamics of intracellular metabolites using untargeted high coverage metabolomics in Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells infected with lytic bacteriophages from six distinct phage genera. Analysis of the metabolomics data indicates an active interference in the host metabolism. In general, phages elicit an increase in pyrimidine and nucleotide sugar metabolism. Furthermore, clear phage-specific and infection stage-specific responses are observed, ranging from extreme metabolite depletion (for example, phage YuA) to complete reorganization of the metabolism (for example, phage phiKZ). As expected, pathways targeted by the phage-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) were enriched among the metabolites changing during infection. The effect on pyrimidine metabolism of phages encoding AMGs capable of host genome degradation (for example, YuA and LUZ19) was distinct from those lacking nuclease-encoding genes (for example, phiKZ), which demonstrates the link between the encoded set of AMGs of a phage and its impact on host physiology. However, a large fraction of the profound effect on host metabolism could not be attributed to the phage-encoded AMGs. We suggest a potentially crucial role for small, ‘non-enzymatic’ peptides in metabolism take-over and hypothesize on potential biotechnical applications for such peptides. The highly phage-specific nature of the metabolic impact emphasizes the potential importance of the ‘phage diversity’ parameter when studying metabolic interactions in complex communities."</span>

Mammary epithelial cells induce androgen receptor (AR) within the mammary mesenchyme and, in response to androgens, the mesenchyme condenses around the epithelial bud, destroying it. We show that this process involves apoptosis and that, in the absence of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) or its receptor, the PTH/PTHrP receptor (PPR1), it fails due to a lack of mesenchymal AR expression. In addition, the expression of tenascin C, another marker of the mammary mesenchyme, is also dependent on PTHrP. PTHrP expression is initiated on E11 and, within the ventral epidermis, is restricted to the forming mammary epithelial bud. In contrast, PPR1 expression is not limited to the mammary bud, but is found generally within the subepidermal mesenchyme. Finally, transgenic overexpression of PTHrP within the basal epidermis induces AR and tenasin C expression within the ventral dermis, suggesting that ectopic expression of PTHrP can induce the ventral mesenchyme to express mammary mesenchyme markers.

ADPKD results from mutations in either of two proteins: polycystin-1 (also known as PC1 or PKD1) or transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily P, member 2 (TRPP2, also known as polycystin-2, PC2, or PKD2). Each of these proteins is expressed in the primary cilium that extends from many renal epithelial cells. Existing evidence suggests that the cilium can promote renal cystogenesis, while PC1 and TRPP2 counter this cystogenic effect. To better understand the function of TRPP2, we investigated its electrophysiological properties in the native ciliary membrane. We recorded directly from the cilia of mIMCD-3 cells, a murine cell line of renal epithelial origin. In one-third of cilia examined, a large-conductance channel was observed. The channel was not permeable to Cl¯ but conducted cations with permeability ratios P K : P Ca : P Na of 1:0.55:0.14. The single-channel conductance ranged from 97 pS in typical physiological solutions to 189 pS in symmetrical 145 mM KCl. Open probability of the channel was very sensitive to membrane depolarization or increasing cytoplasmic free Ca 2+ in the low micromolar range, with the open probability increasing in either case. Knocking out TRPP2 by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing eliminated the channel current, establishing it as TRPP2 dependent.

Mutant analyses suggest that the primary motors for mitochondrial movement in larval motor axons are kinesin-1 (anterograde) and cytoplasmic dynein (retrograde), and interestingly that kinesin-1 is critical for retrograde transport by dynein. During transport, there was little evidence that force production by the two opposing motors was competitive, suggesting a mechanism for alternate coordination. Tests of the possible coordination factor P150 Glued suggested that it indeed influenced both motors on axonal mitochondria, but there was no evidence that its function was critical for the motor coordination mechanism. Observation of organelle-filled axonal swellings (“organelle jams” or “clogs”) caused by kinesin and dynein mutations showed that mitochondria could move vigorously within and pass through them, indicating that they were not the simple steric transport blockades suggested previously.

CGRP may inhibit the activities of both innate and adaptive immune cells, but the molecular pathways underlying this function are largely unknown. In this study, we identify CGRP as a potent inhibitor of TLR-stimulated production of inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α and CCL4, by murine dendritic cells. Inhibition of TLR responses was independent of IL-10 and did not involve perturbation of canonical TLR signaling, including activation of MAPK and NF-κB. Instead, the inhibitory activity of CGRP was mediated by the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway leading to rapid up-regulation of the transcriptional repressor, inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER). Ectopically expressed ICER directly repressed the LPS-stimulated activity of a synthetic Tnf promoter, as well as TNF-α protein production driven by the endogenous promoter. Inhibition of dendritic cell gene expression by CGRP was associated with the presence of a composite cAMP response element/κB promoter element. In a murine model of endotoxemia, CGRP markedly attenuated serum TNF-α levels, and this effect was associated with the up-regulation of ICER. Together, these results establish a novel pathway for the negative regulation of TLR responses through the nervous system that critically involves induction of the transcriptional repressor ICER by the neuropeptide CGRP."</span>

The ancient Panin sites from Côte d'Ivoire constitute the only evidence of prehistoric ape behavior known to date anywhere in the world. Recent archaeological work has yielded behaviorally modified stones, dated by chronometric means to 4,300 years of age, lodging starch residue suggestive of prehistoric dietary practices by ancient chimpanzees. The “Chimpanzee Stone Age” pre-dates the advent of settled farming villages in this part of the African rainforest and suggests that percussive material culture could have been inherited from an common human–chimpanzee clade, rather than invented by hominins, or have arisen by imitation, or resulted from independent technological convergence."</span>

High-resolution electron microscopy of infected mouse bladders revealed that type 1 pilus tips interacted directly with the lumenal surface of the bladder, which is embedded with hexagonal arrays of integral membrane glycoproteins known as uroplakins. Attached pili were shortened and facilitated intimate contact of the bacteria with the uroplakin-coated host cells. Bacterial attachment resulted in exfoliation of host bladder epithelial cells as part of an innate host defense system. Exfoliation occurred through a rapid apoptosis-like mechanism involving caspase activation and host DNA fragmentation. Bacteria resisted clearance in the face of host defenses within the bladder by invading into the epithelium."</span>

Various members of this family have been targets of structural and functional investigations for over four decades. Recently, atomic structures have been determined for Ca 2+ -ATPase by X-ray crystallography, which not only reveal the architecture of these molecules but also offer the opportunity to understand the structural mechanisms by which the energy of ATP is coupled to calcium transport across the membrane. This energy coupling is accomplished by large-scale conformational changes. The transmembrane domain undergoes plastic deformations under the influence of calcium binding at the transport site. Cytoplasmic domains undergo dramatic rigid-body movements that deliver substrates to the catalytic site and that establish new domain interfaces. By comparing various structures and correlating functional data, we can now begin to associate the chemical changes constituting the reaction cycle with structural changes in these domains."</span>

A major impediment to understanding the mechanistic basis of these symbioses has been lack of genetic manipulation tools, for instance, those enabling transgenic GFP expression systems for in vivo visualization. Here, we transform the ‘son‐killer’ reproductive parasite Arsenophonus nasoniae that infects the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis with the plasmid pOM1‐ gfp , re‐introduce this strain to N. vitripennis and then used this system to track symbiont life history in vivo. These data revealed transfer of the symbiont into the fly pupa by N. vitripennis during oviposition and N. vitripennis larvae developing infection over time through feeding. A strong tropism of A. nasoniae to the N. vitripennis ovipositor developed during wasp pupation, which aids onward transmission. The symbiont was also visualized in diapause larvae. Occasional necrotic diapause larvae were observed which displayed intense systemic infection alongside widespread melanotic nodules indicative of an active but failed immune response. Our results provide the foundation for the study of this symbiosis through in vivo tracking of the fate of symbionts through host development, which is rarely achieved in heritable microbe/insect interactions."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"A model was built to examine the kinetics of regulatory cascades such as occur in developmental gene networks. The model relates occupancy of cis-regulatory target sites to transcriptional initiation rate, and thence to RNA and protein output. The model was used to simulate regulatory cascades in which genes encoding transcription factors are successively activated. Using realistic parameter ranges based on extensive earlier measurements in sea urchin embryos, we find that transitions of regulatory states occur sharply in these simulations, with respect to time or changing transcription factor concentrations. As is often observed in developing systems, the simulated regulatory cascades display a succession of gene activations separated by delays of some hours. The most important causes of this behavior are cooperativity in the assembly of cis-regulatory complexes and the high specificity of transcription factors for their target sites. Successive transitions in state occur long in advance of the approach to steady-state levels of the molecules that drive the process. The kinetics of such developmental systems thus depend mainly on the initial output rates of genes activated in response to the advent of new transcription factors."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The fragile X syndrome, a common cause of inherited mental retardation, is characterized by an unusual mode of inheritance. Phenotypic expression has been linked to abnormal cytosine methylation of a single CpG island, at or very near the fragile site. Probes adjacent to this island detected very localized DNA rearrangements that constituted the fragile X mutations, and whose target was a 550-base pair GC-rich fragment. Normal transmitting males had a 150- to 400-base pair insertion that was inherited by their daughters either unchanged, or with small differences in size. Fragile X-positive individuals in the next generation had much larger fragments that differed among siblings and showed a generally heterogeneous pattern indicating somatic mutation. The mutated allele appeared unmethylated in normal transmitting males, methylated only on the inactive X chromosome in their daughters, and totally methylated in most fragile X males. However, some males had a mosaic pattern. Expression of the fragile X syndrome thus appears to result from a two-step mutation as well as a highly localized methylation. Carriers of the fragile X mutation can easily be detected regardless of sex or phenotypic expression, and rare apparent false negatives may result from genetic heterogeneity or misdiagnosis."</span>

The technique of nuclear transplantation has shown to what extent the nuclei of differentiating cells can promote the formation of different cell types (e.g. King &amp; Briggs, 1956; Gurdon, 1960c). Yet no experiments have so far been published on the transplantation of nuclei from fully differentiated normal cells. This is partly because it is difficult to obtain meaningful results from such experiments. The small amount of cytoplasm in differentiated cells renders their nuclei susceptible to damage through exposure to the saline medium, and this makes it difficult to assess the significance of the abnormalities resulting from their transplantation.

We found that natural selection is acting to cause slow, gradual evolutionary change. The descendants of these women are predicted to be on average slightly shorter and stouter, to have lower total cholesterol levels and systolic blood pressure, to have their first child earlier, and to reach menopause later than they would in the absence of evolution.

We randomly assigned participants to a mixed-race team and used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify brain regions involved in processing novel in-group and out-group members independently of preexisting attitudes, stereotypes, or familiarity. Whereas previous research on intergroup perception found amygdala activity—typically interpreted as negativity—in response to stigmatized social groups, we found greater activity in the amygdala, fusiform gyri, orbitofrontal cortex, and dorsal striatum when participants viewed novel in-group faces than when they viewed novel out-group faces. Moreover, activity in orbitofrontal cortex mediated the in-group bias in self-reported liking for the faces. These in-group biases in neural activity were not moderated by race or by whether participants explicitly attended to team membership or race, a finding suggesting that they may occur automatically.

Here, we have identified a subset of human neutrophils with a distinct profile of cell-surface receptors [CD54high, CXC chemokine receptor 1low (CXCR1low)], which represent cells that have migrated through an endothelial monolayer and then re-emerged by reverse transmigration (RT). RT neutrophils, when in contact with endothelium, were rescued from apoptosis, demonstrate functional priming, and were rheologically distinct from neutrophils that had not undergone transendothelial migration. In vivo, 1–2% of peripheral blood neutrophils in patients with systemic inflammation exhibit a RT phenotype. A smaller population existed in healthy donors (≈0.25%). RT neutrophils were distinct from naïve circulatory neutrophils (CD54low, CXCR1high) and naïve cells after activation with formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (CD54low, CXCR1low). It is important that the RT phenotype (CD54high, CXCR1low) is also distinct from tissue-resident neutrophils (CD54low, CXCR1low). Our results demonstrate that neutrophils can migrate in a retrograde direction across endothelial cells and suggest that a population of tissue-experienced neutrophils with a distinct phenotype and function are present in the peripheral circulation in humans in vivo."</span>

Here we unravel some of these interactions by characterising the functional features of the microbial community of the sponge Cymbastela concentrica through a combined metagenomic and metaproteomic approach. We discover the expression of specific transport functions for typical sponge metabolites (for example, halogenated aromatics, dipeptides), which indicates metabolic interactions between the community and the host. We also uncover the simultaneous performance of aerobic nitrification and anaerobic denitrification, which would aid to remove ammonium secreted by the sponge. Our analysis also highlights the requirement for the microbial community to respond to variable environmental conditions and hence express an array of stress protection proteins. Molecular interactions between symbionts and their host might also be mediated by a set of expressed eukaryotic-like proteins and cell–cell mediators. Finally, some sponge-associated bacteria (for example, a Phyllobacteriaceae phylotype) appear to undergo an evolutionary adaptation process to the sponge environment as evidenced by active mobile genetic elements. Our data clearly show that a combined metaproteogenomic approach can provide novel information on the activities, physiology and interactions of sponge-associated microbial communities."</span>

To test this hypothesis, constitutively active MAPKK mutants were designed that had basal activities up to 400 times greater than that of the unphosphorylated wild-type kinase. Expression of these mutants in mammalian cells activated AP-1-regulated transcription. The cells formed transformed foci, grew efficiently in soft agar, and were highly tumorigenic in nude mice.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The developmental fate of primordial germ cells in the mammalian gonad depends on their environment. In the XY gonad, Sry induces a cascade of molecular and cellular events leading to the organization of testis cords. Germ cells are sequestered inside testis cords by 12.5 dpc where they arrest in mitosis. If the testis pathway is not initiated, germ cells spontaneously enter meiosis by 13.5 dpc, and the gonad follows the ovarian fate. We have previously shown that some testis-specific events, such as mesonephric cell migration, can be experimentally induced into XX gonads prior to 12.5 dpc. However, after that time, XX gonads are resistant to the induction of cell migration. In current experiments, we provide evidence that this effect is dependent on XX germ cells rather than on XX somatic cells. We show that,although mesonephric cell migration cannot be induced into normal XX gonads at 14.5 dpc, it can be induced into XX gonads depleted of germ cells. We also show that when 14.5 dpc XX somatic cells are recombined with XY somatic cells,testis cord structures form normally; however, when XX germ cells are recombined with XY somatic cells, cord structures are disrupted. Sandwich culture experiments suggest that the inhibitory effect of XX germ cells is mediated through short-range interactions rather than through a long-range diffusible factor. The developmental stage at which XX germ cells show a disruptive effect on the male pathway is the stage at which meiosis is normally initiated, based on the immunodetection of meiotic markers. We suggest that at the stage when germ cells commit to meiosis, they reinforce ovarian fate by antagonizing the testis pathway."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Traditional and molecular typing schemes for the characterization of pathogenic microorganisms are poorly portable because they index variation that is difficult to compare among laboratories. To overcome these problems, we propose multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which exploits the unambiguous nature and electronic portability of nucleotide sequence data for the characterization of microorganisms. To evaluate MLST, we determined the sequences of ≈470-bp fragments from 11 housekeeping genes in a reference set of 107 isolates of Neisseria meningitidis from invasive disease and healthy carriers. For each locus, alleles were assigned arbitrary numbers and dendrograms were constructed from the pairwise differences in multilocus allelic profiles by cluster analysis. The strain associations obtained were consistent with clonal groupings previously determined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. A subset of six gene fragments was chosen that retained the resolution and congruence achieved by using all 11 loci. Most isolates from hyper-virulent lineages of serogroups A, B, and C meningococci were identical for all loci or differed from the majority type at only a single locus. MLST using six loci therefore reliably identified the major meningococcal lineages associated with invasive disease. MLST can be applied to almost all bacterial species and other haploid organisms, including those that are difficult to cultivate. The overwhelming advantage of MLST over other molecular typing methods is that sequence data are truly portable between laboratories, permitting one expanding global database per species to be placed on a World-Wide Web site, thus enabling exchange of molecular typing data for global epidemiology via the Internet."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Motivation: A few years ago, FlyBase undertook to design a new database schema to store Drosophila data. It would fully integrate genomic sequence and annotation data with bibliographic, genetic, phenotypic and molecular data from the literature representing a distillation of the first 100 years of research on this major animal model system. In developing this new integrated schema, FlyBase also made a commitment to ensure that its design was generic, extensible and available as open source, so that it could be employed as the core schema of any model organism data repository, thereby avoiding redundant software development and potentially increasing interoperability. Our question was whether we could create a relational database schema that would be successfully reused. Results: Chado is a relational database schema now being used to manage biological knowledge for a wide variety of organisms, from human to pathogens, especially the classes of information that directly or indirectly can be associated with genome sequences or the primary RNA and protein products encoded by a genome. Biological databases that conform to this schema can interoperate with one another, and with application software from the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) toolkit. Chado is distinctive because its design is driven by ontologies. The use of ontologies (or controlled vocabularies) is ubiquitous across the schema, as they are used as a means of typing entities. The Chado schema is partitioned into integrated subschemas (modules), each encapsulating a different biological domain, and each described using representations in appropriate ontologies. To illustrate this methodology, we describe here the Chado modules used for describing genomic sequences. Availability: GMOD is a collaboration of several model organism database groups, including FlyBase, to develop a set of open-source software for managing model organism data.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Summary Oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) with unmethylated CpG dinucleotides mimic the immune stimulatory activity of bacterial DNA in vertebrates and are recognized by Toll‐like receptor 9 (TLR9). It is also possible to detect immune activation with certain phosphorothioate sequences that lack CpG motifs. These ODN are less potent than CpG ODN and the mechanism by which they stimulate mammalian leucocytes is not understood. We here provide several lines of evidence demonstrating that the effects induced by non‐CpG ODN are mediated by TLR9. First, non‐CpG ODN could not stimulate cytokine secretion from the splenocytes of TLR9‐deficient (TLR9 –/– ) mice. Second, immunization of TLR9 +/+ but not TLR9 –/– mice with non‐CpG ODN enhanced antigen‐specific antibody responses, although these were T helper type 2 (Th2)‐biased. Third, reactivity to non‐CpG ODN could be reconstituted by transfection of human TLR9 into non‐responsive cells. In addition, we define a new efficient immune stimulatory motif aside from the CpG dinucleotide that consists of a 5′‐TC dinucleotide in a thymidine‐rich background. Non‐CpG ODN containing this motif induced activation of human B cells, but lacked stimulation of Th1‐like cytokines and chemokines. Our study indicates that TLR9 can mediate either efficient Th1‐ or Th2‐dominated effects depending on whether it is stimulated by CpG or certain non‐CpG ODN."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), a neurogenetic condition, is the most common microdeletion syndrome affecting 1 in 2,000–4,000 live births and involving haploinsufficiency of ∼50 genes resulting in a multisystem disorder. Phenotypic expression is highly variable and ranges from severe life‐threatening conditions to only a few associated features. Most common medical problems include: congenital heart disease, in particular conotruncal anomalies; palatal abnormalities, most frequently velopharyngeal incompetence (VPI); immunodeficiency; hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism; genitourinary anomalies; severe feeding/gastrointestinal differences; and subtle dysmorphic facial features. The neurocognitive profile is also highly variable, both between individuals and during the course of development. From infancy onward, motor delays (often with hypotonia) and speech/language deficits are commonly observed. During the preschool and primary school ages, learning difficulties are very common. The majority of patients with 22q11.2DS have an intellectual level that falls in the borderline range (IQ 70–84), and about one‐third have mild to moderate intellectual disability. More severe levels of intellectual disability are uncommon in children and adolescents but are more frequent in adults. Individuals with 22q11.2DS are at an increased risk for developing several psychiatric disorders including attention deficit with hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety and mood disorders, and psychotic disorders and schizophrenia.

Healthy adults ( n = 31) were randomized to receive a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of motavizumab-YTE or motavizumab (0.3, 3, 15, or 30 mg/kg) and followed for 240 days. Clearance of motavizumab-YTE was significantly lower (71% to 86%) and the half-life ( t 1/2 ) was 2- to 4-fold longer than with motavizumab. However, similar peak concentrations and volume-of-distribution values, indicative of similar distribution properties, were seen at all dose levels. The sustained serum concentrations of motavizumab-YTE were fully functional, as shown by RSV neutralizing activity that persisted for 240 days with motavizumab-YTE versus 90 days postdose for motavizumab. Safety and incidence of ADA were comparable between groups. In this first study of an Fc-modified monoclonal antibody in humans, motavizumab-YTE was well tolerated and exhibited an extended half-life of up to 100 days.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Acidocalcisomes are acidic Ca2+-storage organelles found in trypanosomatids that are similar to organelles known historically as volutin granules. Acidification of these organelles is driven in part by a vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase (V-H+-PPase), an enzyme that is also present in plant vacuoles and in some bacteria. Here, we report the cloning and sequencing of a gene encoding the acidocalcisomal V-H+-PPase of Trypanosoma cruzi. The protein (T. cruzi pyrophosphatase, TcPPase) predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the gene has 816 amino acids and a molecular mass of 85kDa. Several sequence motifs found in plant V-H+-PPases were present in TcPPase, explaining its sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide and N,N´-dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide. Heterologous expression of the cDNA encoding TcPPase in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae produced a functional enzyme. Phylogenetic analysis of the available V-H+-PPase sequences indicates that TcPPase is nearer to the vascular plant cluster and the branch containing Chara, a precursor to land plants, than to any of the other pyrophosphatase sequences included in the analysis. The apparent lack of such a V-H+-PPase in mammalian cells may provide a target for the development of new drugs."</span>

We found that M1 has 2 subdivisions. A rostral region lacks CM cells and represents an “old” M1 that is the standard for many mammals. The descending commands mediated by corticospinal efferents from old M1 must use the integrative mechanisms of the spinal cord to generate motoneuron activity and motor output. In contrast, a caudal region of M1 contains shoulder, elbow, and finger CM cells. This region represents a “new” M1 that is present only in some higher primates and humans. The direct access to motoneurons afforded by CM cells enables the newly recognized M1 to bypass spinal cord mechanisms and sculpt novel patterns of motor output that are essential for highly skilled movements."</span>

In most cases, this depends on recognition of a modified nucleotide cap on the 5′ end of the mRNA. However, an alternate pathway uses a structured RNA element in the 5′ untranslated region of the messenger or viral RNA called an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). Here, we present a cryo-electron microscopy map of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES bound to the 40 S ribosomal subunit at about 20 Å resolution.

These advantages partially explain the abundance and variety of discontinuous fibre composites that have evolved in the natural world.

Here we present an additive manufacturing approach that combines real-time colloidal assembly with existing additive manufacturing technologies to create highly programmable discontinuous fibre composites. This technology, termed as ‘3D magnetic printing’, has enabled us to recreate complex bioinspired reinforcement architectures that deliver enhanced material performance compared with monolithic structures.

Other than the site of mutation within the c-kit gene, prognostic features of GIST remain undefined. IM can exhibit off-target effects such as triggering natural killer (NK) cell activity. We addressed whether NK cell functions could predict long term survival with IM. NK cell functions were followed up in 77 GIST patients enrolled onto two phase III trials. “Immunologic responders” were defined as patients whose NK cell IFN-γ values after 2 months of IM were higher than or equal to the baseline value at entry into the trial. The prognostic effect of IFN-γ on progression-free survival was assessed by a Wald test in a Cox regression analysis using the landmark method and stratified by trial and on the c-kit mutational status. Fifty-six patients were evaluable for the NK cell IFN-γ responses at baseline and 2 months. Their median follow-up for progression-free survival was 3.7 years. Thirty-four of 56 patients were immunologic responders to IM. In the Cox regression analysis, immunologic responders possessed a hazard ratio of progression or death equal to 0.29 (95% confidence interval, 0.12–0.70; P = 0.006) compared with nonresponders. Kaplan-Meier 2-year survival estimates were 85% for immunologic responders and 50% for nonresponders. Moreover, the immunologic response added prognostic value to the c-kit mutation.

Although mDia nucleates actin filaments, it is unclear whether this or a separate activity of mDia underlies MT stabilization. We generated two actin mutants (K853A and I704A) in a constitutively active version of mDia2 containing formin homology domains 1 and 2 (FH1FH2) and found that they still induced stable MTs and bound to the MT TIP proteins EB1 and APC, which have also been implicated in MT stabilization. A dimerization-impaired mutant of mDia2 (W630A) also generated stable MTs in cells. We examined whether FH1FH2mDia2 had direct activity on MTs in vitro and found that it bound directly to MTs, stabilized MTs against cold- and dilution-induced disassembly, and reduced the rates of growth and shortening during MT assembly and disassembly, respectively. These results indicate that mDia2 has a novel MT stabilization activity that is separate from its actin nucleation activity."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Although the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning has become a major focus in ecology, its significance in a fluctuating environment is still poorly understood. According to the insurance hypothesis, biodiversity insures ecosystems against declines in their functioning because many species provide greater guarantees that some will maintain functioning even if others fail. Here we examine this hypothesis theoretically. We develop a general stochastic dynamic model to assess the effects of species richness on the expected temporal mean and variance of ecosystem processes such as productivity, based on individual species’ productivity responses to environmental fluctuations. Our model shows two major insurance effects of species richness on ecosystem productivity: ( i ) a buffering effect, i.e., a reduction in the temporal variance of productivity, and ( ii ) a performance-enhancing effect, i.e., an increase in the temporal mean of productivity. The strength of these insurance effects is determined by three factors: ( i ) the way ecosystem productivity is determined by individual species responses to environmental fluctuations, ( ii ) the degree of asynchronicity of these responses, and ( iii ) the detailed form of these responses. In particular, the greater the variance of the species responses, the lower the species richness at which the temporal mean of the ecosystem process saturates and the ecosystem becomes redundant. These results provide a strong theoretical foundation for the insurance hypothesis, which proves to be a fundamental principle for understanding the long-term effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes."</span>

Their origin and role in diastolic dysfunction, a hallmark of cardiac aging and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, remain unclear. Here we show that cardiac macrophages expand in humans and mice with diastolic dysfunction, which in mice was induced by either hypertension or advanced age. A higher murine myocardial macrophage density results from monocyte recruitment and increased hematopoiesis in bone marrow and spleen. In humans, we observed a parallel constellation of hematopoietic activation: circulating myeloid cells are more frequent, and splenic 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging signal correlates with echocardiographic indices of diastolic dysfunction. While diastolic dysfunction develops, cardiac macrophages produce IL-10, activate fibroblasts, and stimulate collagen deposition, leading to impaired myocardial relaxation and increased myocardial stiffness. Deletion of IL-10 in macrophages improves diastolic function. These data imply expansion and phenotypic changes of cardiac macrophages as therapeutic targets for cardiac fibrosis leading to diastolic dysfunction."</span>

In this article we have tested the ability of two Tm isoforms, TmBr3 and the human homologue of Tm5 (hTM5 NM1 ), to regulate actin filament function. We found that these Tms can differentially alter actin filament organization, cell size, and shape. hTm5 NM1 was able to recruit myosin II into stress fibers, which resulted in decreased lamellipodia and cellular migration. In contrast, TmBr3 transfection induced lamellipodial formation, increased cellular migration, and reduced stress fibers. Based on coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization studies, TmBr3 appeared to be associated with actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilin (ADF)-bound actin filaments. Additionally, the Tms can specifically regulate the incorporation of other Tms into actin filaments, suggesting that selective dimerization may also be involved in the control of actin filament organization. We conclude that Tm isoforms can be used to specify the functional properties and molecular composition of actin filaments and that spatial segregation of isoforms may lead to localized specialization of actin filament function."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Nanoscale plasmonic assemblies display exceptionally strong chiral optical activity. So far, their structural design was primarily driven by challenges related to metamaterials whose practical applications are remote. Here we demonstrate that gold nanorods assembled by the polymerase chain reaction into DNA-bridged chiral systems have promising analytical applications. The chiroplasmonic activity of side-by-side assembled patterns is attributed to a 7–9 degree twist between the nanorod axes. This results in a strong polarization rotation that matches theoretical expectations. The amplitude of the bisignate ‘wave’ in the circular dichroism spectra of side-by-side assemblies demonstrates excellent linearity with the amount of target DNA. The limit of detection for DNA using side-by-side assemblies is as low as 3.7 aM. This chiroplasmonic method may be particularly useful for biological analytes larger than 2–5 nm which are difficult to detect by methods based on plasmon coupling and ‘hot spots’. Circular polarization increases for inter-nanorod gaps between 2 and 20 nm when plasmonic coupling rapidly decreases. Reaching the attomolar limit of detection for simple and reliable bioanalysis of oligonucleotides may have a crucial role in DNA biomarker detection for early diagnostics of different diseases, forensics and environmental monitoring."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The upper respiratory tract is continually assaulted with harmful dusts and xenobiotics carried on the incoming airstream. Detection of such irritants by the trigeminal nerve evokes protective reflexes, including sneezing, apnea, and local neurogenic inflammation of the mucosa. Although free intra-epithelial nerve endings can detect certain lipophilic irritants (e.g., mints, ammonia), the epithelium also houses a population of trigeminally innervated solitary chemosensory cells (SCCs) that express T2R bitter taste receptors along with their downstream signaling components. These SCCs have been postulated to enhance the chemoresponsive capabilities of the trigeminal irritant-detection system. Here we show that transduction by the intranasal solitary chemosensory cells is necessary to evoke trigeminally mediated reflex reactions to some irritants including acyl–homoserine lactone bacterial quorum-sensing molecules, which activate the downstream signaling effectors associated with bitter taste transduction. Isolated nasal chemosensory cells respond to the classic bitter ligand denatonium as well as to the bacterial signals by increasing intracellular Ca 2 + . Furthermore, these same substances evoke changes in respiration indicative of trigeminal activation. Genetic ablation of either Gα-gustducin or TrpM5, essential elements of the T2R transduction cascade, eliminates the trigeminal response. Because acyl–homoserine lactones serve as quorum-sensing molecules for Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, detection of these substances by airway chemoreceptors offers a means by which the airway epithelium may trigger an epithelial inflammatory response before the bacteria reach population densities capable of forming destructive biofilms."</span>

These biofilms are a significant medical problem because they commonly form on implanted medical devices, are drug resistant and are difficult to remove. C . albicans biofilms are not static structures; rather they are dynamic and develop over time. Here we characterize gene expression in biofilms during their development, and by comparing them to multiple planktonic reference states, we identify patterns of gene expression relevant to biofilm formation. In particular, we document time‐dependent changes in genes involved in adhesion and metabolism, both of which are at the core of biofilm development. Additionally, we identify three new regulators of biofilm formation, F lo8, G al4, and R fx2, which play distinct roles during biofilm development over time. F lo8 is required for biofilm formation at all time points, and G al4 and R fx2 are needed for proper biofilm formation at intermediate time points."</span>

Though numerous cellular and molecular players are known, the mechanism of chemical-induced sensitization remains poorly understood. Here, we identify neutrophils as crucial players in the sensitization phase of CHS. Genetic deficiency of neutrophils caused by myeloid-specific deletion of Mcl-1 or antibody-mediated depletion of neutrophils before sensitization abrogated the CHS response. Neutrophil deficiency reduced contact allergen-induced cytokine production, gelatinase release, and reactive oxygen species production in naive mice. Mast cell deficiency inhibited neutrophil accumulation at the site of sensitization. In turn, neutrophils were required for contact allergen-induced release of further neutrophil-attracting chemokines, migration of DCs to the draining lymph nodes, and priming of allergen-specific T cells. Lymph node cells from mice sensitized in the absence of neutrophils failed to transfer sensitization to naive recipients. Furthermore, no CHS response could be induced when neutrophils were depleted before elicitation or when normally sensitized lymph node cells were transferred to neutrophil-deficient recipients, indicating an additional role for neutrophils in the elicitation phase. Collectively, our data identify neutrophils to be critically involved in both the sensitization and elicitation phase of CHS."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Mycobacterium tuberculosis successfully parasitizes macrophages by disrupting the maturation of its phagosome, creating an intracellular compartment with endosomal rather than lysosomal characteristics. We have recently demonstrated that live M. tuberculosis infect human macrophages in the absence of an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c), which correlates with inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion and intracellular viability. In contrast, killed M. tuberculosis induces an elevation in [Ca2+]c that is coupled to phagosome-lysosome fusion. We tested the hypothesis that defective activation of the Ca2+-dependent effector proteins calmodulin (CaM) and CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) contributes to the intracellular pathogenesis of tuberculosis. Phagosomes containing live M. tuberculosis exhibited decreased levels of CaM and the activated form of CaMKII compared with phagosomes encompassing killed tubercle bacilli. Furthermore, ionophore-induced elevations in [Ca2+]c resulted in recruitment of CaM and activation of CaMKII on phagosomes containing live M. tuberculosis. Specific inhibitors of CaM or CaMKII blocked Ca2+ ionophore-induced phagosomal maturation and enhanced the bacilli’s intracellular viability. These results demonstrate a novel role for CaM and CaMKII in the regulation of phagosome-lysosome fusion and suggest that defective activation of these Ca2+-activated signaling components contributes to the successful parasitism of human macrophages by M. tuberculosis."</span>

How genes are modulated so precisely is not well understood. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates target genes by associating with specific DNA binding sites, the sequences of which differ between genes. Traditionally, these binding sites have been viewed only as docking sites. Using structural, biochemical, and cell-based assays, we show that GR binding sequences, differing by as little as a single base pair, differentially affect GR conformation and regulatory activity. We therefore propose that DNA is a sequence-specific allosteric ligand of GR that tailors the activity of the receptor toward specific target genes."</span>

Vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP+) interneurons occupy a distinct niche in circuitry as many of them specialize in innervating GABAergic cells, thus providing network disinhibition. In the CA1 hippocampus, VIP+ interneuron-selective cells target local interneurons. Here, we discover a type of VIP+ neuron whose axon innervates CA1 and also projects to the subiculum (VIP-LRPs). VIP-LRPs show specific molecular properties and target interneurons within the CA1 area but both interneurons and pyramidal cells within subiculum. They are interconnected through gap junctions but demonstrate sparse spike coupling in vitro. In awake mice, VIP-LRPs decrease their activity during theta-run epochs and are more active during quiet wakefulness but not coupled to sharp-wave ripples.

We describe a comprehensive analysis of the mutational landscape of these tumours, combining whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing. We identify an average of 14±5 somatic mutations in coding sequences of sorted monocyte DNA and the signatures of three mutational processes. Serial sequencing demonstrates that the response to hypomethylating agents is associated with changes in DNA methylation and gene expression, without any decrease in the mutation allele burden, nor prevention of new genetic alteration occurence.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract In addition to their hemostatic role, platelets play a significant role in immunity. Once activated, platelets release extracellular vesicles (EVs) formed by the budding of their cytoplasmic membranes. Because of their heterogeneity, platelet EVs (PEVs) are thought to perform diverse functions. It is unknown, however, whether the proteasome is transferred from platelets to PEVs or whether its function is retained. We hypothesized that functional protein processing and antigen presentation machinery are transferred to PEVs by activated platelets. Using molecular and functional assays, we found that the active 20S proteasome was enriched in PEVs, along with major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and lymphocyte costimulatory molecules (CD40L and OX40L). Proteasome-containing PEVs were identified in healthy donor blood, but did not increase in platelet concentrates that caused adverse transfusion reactions. They were augmented, however, after immune complex injections in mice. The complete biodistribution of murine PEVs after injection into mice revealed that they principally reached lymphoid organs, such as spleen and lymph nodes, in addition to the bone marrow, and to a lesser extent, liver and lungs. The PEV proteasome processed exogenous ovalbumin (OVA) and loaded its antigenic peptide onto MHC-I molecules, which promoted OVA-specific CD8+ T-lymphocyte proliferation. These results suggest that PEVs contribute to adaptive immunity through cross-presentation of antigens and have privileged access to immune cells through the lymphatic system, a tissue location that is inaccessible to platelets."</span>

Recent studies suggest that glia may contribute to motoneuron injury in animal models of familial ALS. To determine whether the expression of mutant SOD1 (mSOD1 G93A ) in CNS microglia contributes to motoneuron injury, PU.1 −/− mice that are unable to develop myeloid and lymphoid cells received bone marrow transplants resulting in donor-derived microglia. Donor-derived microglia from mice overexpressing mSOD1 G93A , an animal model of familial ALS, transplanted into PU.1 −/− mice could not induce weakness, motoneuron injury, or an ALS-like disease. To determine whether expression of mSOD1 G93A in motoneurons and astroglia, as well as microglia, was required to produce motoneuron disease, PU.1 −/− mice were bred with mSOD1 G93A mice. In mSOD1 G93A /PU.1 −/− mice, wild-type donor-derived microglia slowed motoneuron loss and prolonged disease duration and survival when compared with mice receiving mSOD1 G93A expressing cells or mSOD1 G93A mice. In vitro studies confirmed that wild-type microglia were less neurotoxic than similarly cultured mSOD1 G93A microglia. Compared with wild-type microglia, mSOD1 G93A microglia produced and released more superoxide and nitrite+nitrate, and induced more neuronal death. These data demonstrate that the expression of mSOD1 G93A results in activated and neurotoxic microglia, and suggests that the lack of mSOD1 G93A expression in microglia may contribute to motoneuron protection.

Most gonococcal infections remain localized to the genital tract but, in a small proportion of untreated cases, the bacterium becomes systemic to produce the serious complication of disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI). We have identified a large region of chromosomal DNA in N. gonorrhoeae that is not found in a subset of gonococcal isolates (a genetic island), in the closely related pathogen, Neisseria meningitidis or in commensal Neisseria that do not usually cause disease . Certain versions of the island carry a serum resistance locus and a gene for the production of a cytotoxin; these versions of the island are found preferentially in DGI isolates. All versions of the genetic island encode homologues of F factor conjugation proteins, suggesting that, like some other pathogenicity islands, this region encodes a conjugation‐like secretion system. Consistent with this hypothesis, a wild‐type strain released large amounts of DNA into the medium during exponential growth without cell lysis, whereas an isogenic strain mutated in a peptidoglycan hydrolase gene ( atlA ) was drastically reduced in its ability to donate DNA for transformation during growth. This genetic island constitutes the first major discriminating factor between the gonococcus and the other Neisseria and carries genes for providing DNA for genetic transformation."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"OBJECTIVE—Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) promotes glucose homeostasis through regulation of islet hormone secretion, as well as hepatic and gastric function. Because GLP-1 is also synthesized in the brain, where it regulates food intake, we hypothesized that the central GLP-1 system regulates glucose tolerance as well. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—We used glucose tolerance tests and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps to assess the role of the central GLP-1 system on glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, and hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity. Finally, in situ hybridization was used to examine colocalization of GLP-1 receptors with neuropeptide tyrosine and pro-opiomelanocortin neurons. RESULTS—We found that central, but not peripheral, administration of low doses of a GLP-1 receptor antagonist caused relative hyperglycemia during a glucose tolerance test, suggesting that activation of central GLP-1 receptors regulates key processes involved in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis. Central administration of GLP-1 augmented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and direct administration of GLP-1 into the arcuate, but not the paraventricular, nucleus of the hypothalamus reduced hepatic glucose production. Consistent with a role for GLP-1 receptors in the arcuate, GLP-1 receptor mRNA was found to be expressed in 68.1% of arcuate neurons that expressed pro-opiomelanocortin mRNA but was not significantly coexpressed with neuropeptide tyrosine. CONCLUSIONS—These data suggest that the arcuate GLP-1 receptors are a key component of the GLP-1 system for improving glucose homeostasis by regulating both insulin secretion and glucose production."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"ABSTRACT Following natural dengue virus (DENV) infection, humans produce some antibodies that recognize only the serotype of infection (type specific) and others that cross-react with all four serotypes (cross-reactive). Recent studies with human antibodies indicate that type-specific antibodies at high concentrations are often strongly neutralizing in vitro and protective in animal models. In general, cross-reactive antibodies are poorly neutralizing and can enhance the ability of DENV to infect Fc receptor-bearing cells under some conditions. Type-specific antibodies at low concentrations also may enhance infection. There is an urgent need to determine whether there are conserved antigenic sites that can be recognized by cross-reactive potently neutralizing antibodies. Here, we describe the isolation of a large panel of naturally occurring human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed to the DENV domain II fusion loop (FL) envelope protein region from subjects following vaccination or natural infection. Most of the FL-specific antibodies exhibited a conventional phenotype, characterized by low-potency neutralizing function and antibody-dependent enhancing activity. One clone, however, recognized the bc loop of domain II adjacent to the FL and exhibited a unique phenotype of ultrahigh potency, neutralizing all four serotypes better than any other previously described MAb recognizing this region. This antibody not only neutralized DENV effectively but also competed for binding against the more prevalent poor-quality antibodies whose binding was focused on the FL. The 1C19 human antibody could be a promising component of a preventative or therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the unique epitope revealed by 1C19 suggests a focus for rational vaccine design based on novel immunogens presenting cross-reactive neutralizing determinants. IMPORTANCE With no effective vaccine available, the incidence of dengue virus (DENV) infections worldwide continues to rise, with more than 390 million infections estimated to occur each year. Due to the unique roles that antibodies are postulated to play in the pathogenesis of DENV infection and disease, there is consensus that a successful DENV vaccine must protect against all four serotypes. If conserved epitopes recognized by naturally occurring potently cross-neutralizing human antibodies could be identified, monovalent subunit vaccine preparations might be developed. We characterized 30 DENV cross-neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and identified one (1C19) that recognized a novel conserved site, known as the bc loop. This antibody has several desirable features, as it neutralizes DENV effectively and competes for binding against the more common low-potency fusion loop (FL) antibodies, which are believed to contribute to antibody-mediated disease. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a potent serotype cross-neutralizing human antibody to DENV."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Studies of temperament from early childhood to adulthood have demonstrated inverse relationships between negative affectivity and effortful control. Effortful control is also positively related to the development of conscience and appears as a protective factor in the development of behavior disorders. In this study, the development of attentional mechanisms underlying effortful control was investigated in 2‐ to 3‐year‐old children, as indexed by their performance in a) making anticipatory eye movements to ambiguous locations and b) resolving conflict between location and identity in a spatial conflict task. The ability to make anticipatory eye movements to ambiguous locations within a sequence was clearly present at 24 months. By 30 months, children could also successfully perform a spatial conflict task that introduced conflict between identity and location, and at that age, children's success on ambiguous anticipatory eye movements was related to lower interference from conflict in the spatial conflict task. Children's performance on the eye‐movement task was correlated with performance and reaction time on spatial tasks, and both were related to aspects of effortful control and negative affect as measured in children's parent‐reported temperament."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"A gene, reaper ( rpr ), that appears to play a central control function for the initiation of programmed cell death (apoptosis) in Drosophila was identified. Virtually all programmed cell death that normally occurs during Drosophila embryogenesis was blocked in embryos homozygous for a small deletion that includes the reaper gene. Mutant embryos contained many extra cells and failed to hatch, but many other aspects of development appeared quite normal. Deletions that include reaper also protected embryos from apoptosis caused by x-irradiation and developmental defects. However, high doses of x-rays induced some apoptosis in mutant embryos, and the resulting corpses were phagocytosed by macrophages. These data suggest that the basic cell death program is intact although it was not activated in mutant embryos. The DNA encompassed by the deletion was cloned and the reaper gene was identified on the basis of the ability of cloned DNA to restore apoptosis to cell death defective embryos in germ line transformation experiments. The reaper gene appears to encode a small peptide that shows no homology to known proteins, and reaper messenger RNA is expressed in cells destined to undergo apoptosis."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"ABSTRACT We elaborate a framework for investigating the evolutionary history of morphological characters. We argue that morphological character trees generated by phylogenetic analysis of transcriptomes provide a useful tool for identifying causal gene expression differences underlying the development and evolution of morphological characters. They also enable rigorous testing of different models of morphological character evolution and origination, including the hypothesis that characters originate via divergence of repeated ancestral characters. Finally, morphological character trees provide evidence that character transcriptomes undergo concerted evolution. We argue that concerted evolution of transcriptomes can explain the so‐called “species signal” found in several recent comparative transcriptome studies. The species signal is the phenomenon that transcriptomes cluster by species rather than character type, even though the characters are older than the respective species. We suggest the species signal is a natural consequence of concerted gene expression evolution resulting from mutations that alter gene regulatory network interactions shared by the characters under comparison. Thus, character trees generated from transcriptomes allow us to investigate the variational independence, or individuation, of morphological characters at the level of genetic programs. J. Exp. Zool.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Caveolae are relatively stable membrane invaginations that compartmentalize signaling, regulate lipid metabolism and mediate viral entry. Caveolae are closely associated with actin fibers and internalize in response to diverse stimuli. Loss of cell adhesion is known to induce rapid and robust caveolae internalization and trafficking toward a Rab11-positive recycling endosome; however, pathways governing this process are poorly understood. Here, we report that filamin A is required to maintain the F-actin-dependent linear distribution of caveolin-1. High spatiotemporal resolution particle tracking of caveolin-1–GFP vesicles by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy revealed that FLNa is required for the F-actin-dependent arrest of caveolin-1 vesicles in a confined area and their stable anchorage to the plasma membrane. The linear distribution and anchorage of caveolin-1 vesicles are both required for proper caveolin-1 inwards trafficking. De-adhesion-triggered caveolae inward trafficking towards a recycling endosome is impaired in FLNa-depleted HeLa and FLNa-deficient M2-melanoma cells. Inwards trafficking of caveolin-1 requires both the ability of FLNa to bind actin and cycling PKCα-dependent phosphorylation of FLNa on Ser2152 after cell detachment."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) participate in numerous cell responses, including proliferation, DNA damage, and cell death. Based on these disparate activities, both promotion and inhibition of ROS have been proposed for cancer therapy. However, how the ROS response is determined is not clear. We examined the activities of ROS in a model of Apc deletion, where loss of the Wnt target gene Myc both rescues APC loss and prevents ROS accumulation. Following APC loss, Myc has been shown to up-regulate RAC1 to promote proliferative ROS through NADPH oxidase (NOX). However, APC loss also increased the expression of TIGAR, which functions to limit ROS. To explore this paradox, we used three-dimensional (3D) cultures and in vivo models to show that deletion of TIGAR increased ROS damage and inhibited proliferation. These responses were suppressed by limiting damaging ROS but enhanced by lowering proproliferative NOX-derived ROS. Despite having opposing effects on ROS levels, loss of TIGAR and RAC1 cooperated to suppress intestinal proliferation following APC loss. Our results indicate that the pro- and anti-proliferative effects of ROS can be independently modulated in the same cell, with two key targets in the Wnt pathway functioning to integrate the different ROS signals for optimal cell proliferation."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Postsynthesis mismatch repair is an important contributor to mutation avoidance and genomic stability in bacteria, yeast, and humans. Regulation of its activity would allow organisms to regulate their ability to evolve. That mismatch repair might be down-regulated in stationary-phase Escherichia coli was suggested by the sequence spectrum of some stationary-phase (“adaptive”) mutations and by the observations that MutS and MutH levels decline during stationary phase. We report that overproduction of MutL inhibits mutation in stationary phase but not during growth. MutS overproduction has no such effect, and MutL overproduction does not prevent stationary-phase decline of either MutS or MutH. These results imply that MutS and MutH decline to levels appropriate for the decreased DNA synthesis in stationary phase, whereas functional MutL is limiting for mismatch repair specifically during stationary phase. Modulation of mutation rate and genetic stability in response to environmental or developmental cues, such as stationary phase and stress, could be important in evolution, development, microbial pathogenicity, and the origins of cancer."</span>

It was found that marrow cells derived from anemic Sl/Sld or Sld/Sld mice, when implanted into heavily irradiated mice of genotype +sl/+sl, are capable of forming macroscopic spleen colonies, with approximately the same frequency as cells derived from normal +sl/+sl mice. Marrow cells derived from Sl/Sld animals were tested for their capacity to cure the anemia of W/Wr mice and were found to implant as rapidly and to have as long-lasting a beneficial effect as did marrow cells from +sl/+sl mice. The radiosensitivity of the colony-forming ability of marrow cells from Sl/Sld mice was found to be similar to that found previously for +sl/+sl marrow cells, although the anemic animals are known to be more sensitive to total-body irradiation than are their normal littermates. Marrow cells from +sl/+sl mice were found to proliferate more slowly in irradiated mice of genotype Sl/Sld than in irradiated +sl/+sl littermates, even when the anemic and the normal mice were joined in parabiosis.

Here, we characterize the supramolecular structures formed by reversible Mg 2+ ‐dependent self‐association of linear 12‐mer nucleosomal arrays using microscopy and physicochemical approaches. These reconstituted chromatin structures, which we call “oligomers”, are globular throughout all stages of cooperative assembly and range in size from ~50 nm to a maximum diameter of ~1,000 nm. The nucleosomal arrays were packaged within the oligomers as interdigitated 10‐nm fibers, rather than folded 30‐nm structures. Linker DNA was freely accessible to micrococcal nuclease, although the oligomers remained partially intact after linker DNA digestion. The organization of chromosomal fibers in human nuclei in situ was stabilized by 1 mM MgCl 2 , but became disrupted in the absence of MgCl 2 , conditions that also dissociated the oligomers in vitro . These results indicate that a 10‐nm array of nucleosomes has the intrinsic ability to self‐assemble into large chromatin globules stabilized by nucleosome–nucleosome interactions, and suggest that the oligomers are a good in vitro model for investigating the structure and organization of interphase chromosomes."</span>

It is required for microbial host defense and is a potent stimulator of granulopoiesis. In a dose-dependent fashion, IL-17A expanded human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and induced the proliferation of mature stroma cells in bone marrow-derived stroma cultures. Recombinant human interleukin-17A (rhIL-17A) nearly doubled colony-forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-f) frequency and almost tripled the surface area covered by stroma. In a murine transplant model, in vivo murine (m)IL-17A expression enhanced CFU-f by 2.5-fold. Enrichment of the graft with CD4+ T-cell resulted in a 7.5-fold increase in CFU-f in normal C57BL/6, but only threefold in IL-17Ra−/− mice on day 14 post-transplant. In this transplant model, in vivo blockade of IL-17A in C57BL/6 mice resembled the phenotype of IL-17Ra−/− mice. Approximately half of the T-cell-mediated effect on MSC recovery following radiation-conditioned transplantation was attributed to the IL-17A/IL-17Ra pathway. Pluripotent MSCs have the potential of regenerating various tissues, and mature stroma cells are critical elements of the hematopoietic microenvironment (HME).

Moreover, miR-9a suppresses Sens expression through its 3′ untranslated region. miR-9a is expressed in epithelial cells, including those adjacent to SOPs within proneural clusters, suggesting that miR-9a normally inhibits neuronal fate in non-SOP cells by down-regulating Sens expression.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Myosin VI supports movement toward the (−) end of actin filaments, despite sharing extensive sequence and structural homology with (+)-end-directed myosins. A class-specific stretch of amino acids inserted between the converter domain and the lever arm was proposed to provide the structural basis of directionality reversal. Indeed, the unique insert mediates a 120° redirection of the lever arm in a crystal structure of the presumed poststroke conformation of myosin VI [Ménétrey J, Bahloul A, Wells AL, Yengo CM, Morris CA, Sweeney HL, Houdusse A (2005) Nature 435:779–785]. However, this redirection alone is insufficient to account for the large (−)-end-directed stroke of a monomeric myosin VI construct. The underlying motion of the myosin VI converter domain must therefore differ substantially from the power stroke of (+)-end-directed myosins. To experimentally map out the motion of the converter domain and lever arm, we have generated a series of truncated myosin VI constructs and characterized the size and direction of the power stroke for each construct using dual-labeled gliding filament assays and optical trapping. Motors truncated near the end of the converter domain generate (+)-end-directed motion, whereas longer constructs move toward the (−) end. Our results directly demonstrate that the unique insert is required for directionality reversal, ruling out a large class of models in which the converter domain moves toward the (−) end. We suggest that the lever arm rotates ≈180° between pre- and poststroke conformations."</span>

Uses in vitro motility and single molecule optical trapping assays to reveal functional structural transitions in myosin VI, suggesting that myosin VI operates by a lever arm mechanism, that this lever arm swings a full 180° and that reverse directionality of myosin VI is determined by the unique insert.
Reference 32 demonstrates that the unique insert in myosin VI is responsible for directionality reversal, specifically by rotating the lever arm 180 degrees during the power stroke.

We hypothesised that in PF OA, braces would decrease knee pain and shrink PF bone marrow lesions (BMLs). Methods Eligible subjects had painful PF OA. Subjects were randomly allocated to brace or no brace for 6 weeks. Knee MRIs were acquired at baseline and 6 weeks. We measured BMLs on post-contrast fat suppressed sagittal and proton density weighted axial images. The primary symptom outcome was change in pain at 6 weeks during a preselected painful activity, and the primary structural outcome was BML volume change in the PF joint. Analyses used multiple linear regression. Results We randomised 126 subjects aged 40–70 years (mean age 55.5 years; 72 females (57.1%)). Mean nominated visual analogue scale (0–10 cm) pain score at baseline was 6.5 cm. 94 knees (75%) had PF BMLs at baseline. Subjects wore the brace for a mean of 7.4 h/day. 6 subjects withdrew during the trial. After accounting for baseline values, the brace group had lower knee pain than the control group at 6 weeks (difference between groups −1.3 cm, 95% CI −2.0 to −0.7; p&lt;0.001) and reduced PF BML volume (difference −490.6 mm 3 , 95% CI −929.5 to −51.7; p=0.03) but not tibiofemoral volume (difference −53.9 mm 3 , 95% CI −625.9 to 518.2; p=0.85).

On the basis of its anatomic connections and single-unit properties, the superior temporal polysensory area (STP) would seem to be primarily involved in visuospatial functions. We have examined the effects of lesions of STP on saccadic eye movements, visual fixation, and smooth pursuit eye movements to directly test the hypothesis that STP is involved in visuospatial and visuomotor behavior. 2. Seven monkeys were trained to make saccades to targets 8, 15, and 22 degrees from a central fixation point along the horizontal meridian and 8 degrees from the central fixation point along the vertical meridian. One monkey was also trained to make saccades to auditory targets. The same monkeys were trained to foveate a stationary central fixation point and to follow it with a smooth pursuit eye movement when it began moving 5, 13, or 20 degrees/s. Four monkeys received unilateral STP lesions, one received a bilateral STP lesion, and as a control, two received unilateral inferior temporal cortex (IT) lesions. After testing, three of the animals with unilateral STP lesions received an additional STP lesion in the hemisphere contralateral to the first lesion. Similarly, one animal with a unilateral IT lesion received an additional IT lesion in the hemisphere contralateral to the first lesion. 3. All monkeys with complete removal of STP showed a significant increase in saccade latency to the most peripheral contralateral target, and most also had increased saccade latencies to the other contralateral targets. Saccades directed to targets along the vertical meridian or toward targets in the hemifield ipsilateral to the lesion were not impaired by removal of STP. By contrast, IT lesions did not impair the monkeys' ability to make saccadic eye movements to visual stimuli at any location, showing that saccades to visually guided targets are not impaired nonspecifically by damage to visual cortex. 4. The deficit in making eye movements after STP lesions was specific to saccade latency, with little effect on the accuracy of saccades to visual targets. 5. In the one monkey trained to make saccades to auditory targets, removal of STP did not impair saccades to auditory targets contralateral to its lesion, despite this monkey showing the largest increase in saccades latencies to visual targets. 6.

In plants, modulation of DNA methylation in response to environmental conditions represents a potentially robust mechanism to regulate gene expression networks; however, examples of dynamic DNA methylation are largely limited to gene imprinting. Here we report an unexpected role for DNA methylation in regulation of the Arabidopsis thaliana immune system. Profiling the DNA methylomes of plants exposed to bacterial pathogen, avirulent bacteria, or salicylic acid (SA) hormone revealed numerous stress-induced differentially methylated regions, many of which were intimately associated with differentially expressed genes. In response to SA, transposon-associated differentially methylated regions, which were accompanied by up-regulation of 21-nt siRNAs, were often coupled to transcriptional changes of the transposon and/or the proximal gene. Thus, dynamic DNA methylation changes within repetitive sequences or transposons can regulate neighboring genes in response to SA stress."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Recent genetic analyses of large populations have revealed that somatic mutations in hematopoietic cells leading to clonal expansion are commonly acquired during human aging. Clonally restricted hematopoiesis is associated with an increased risk of subsequent diagnosis of myeloid or lymphoid neoplasia and increased all-cause mortality. Although myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are defined by cytopenias, dysplastic morphology of blood and marrow cells, and clonal hematopoiesis, most individuals who acquire clonal hematopoiesis during aging will never develop MDS. Therefore, acquisition of somatic mutations that drive clonal expansion in the absence of cytopenias and dysplastic hematopoiesis can be considered clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), analogous to monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, which are precursor states for hematologic neoplasms but are usually benign and do not progress. Because mutations are frequently observed in healthy older persons, detection of an MDS-associated somatic mutation in a cytopenic patient without other evidence of MDS may cause diagnostic uncertainty. Here we discuss the nature and prevalence of CHIP, distinction of this state from MDS, and current areas of uncertainty regarding diagnostic criteria for myeloid malignancies."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"1. Posterior parietal cortex contains neurons that are visually responsive and active in relation to saccadic eye movements. We recorded from single neurons in a subregion of parietal cortex, the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), in alert rhesus monkeys. To characterize more completely the circumstances under which LIP neurons are responsive, we used five tasks designed to test the impact of sensory, motor, and cognitive factors. We obtained quantitative data in multiple tasks in 91 neurons. We measured neural activity during central fixation and in relation to stimulus onset and saccade onset. 2. LIP neurons have visual responses to the onset of a stationary stimulus in the receptive field. These visual responses occurred both in tasks that require a subsequent eye movement toward the stimulus and in tasks in which eye movements are not permitted, indicating that this activity is sensory rather than presaccadic. 3. Visual responses were enhanced when the monkey had to use information provided by the stimulus to guide its behavior. The amplitude of the sensory response to a given stimulus was increased in a task in which the monkey would subsequently make a saccade to the location signaled by the stimulus, as compared with the amplitude of the visual response in a simple fixation task. 4. The visual response was also enhanced when the monkey attended to the stimulus without looking at it. This result shows that enhancement does not reflect saccade preparation because the response is enhanced even when the monkey is not permitted to make a saccade. Instead, enhancement reflects the allocation of attention to the spatial locus of the receptive field. 5. Many LIP neurons had saccade-related activity in addition to their visual responses. The visual response for most neurons was stronger than the saccade-related activation. 6. Saccade-related activity was independent of visual activity. Similar presaccadic activity was observed in trials that included a recent visual stimulus (memory-guided saccade task) and in trials with no visual stimulus (learned saccade task). 7. We observed increases in activity during fixation in tasks in which the monkey could anticipate the onset of a behaviorally significant stimulus. LIP neurons usually showed low levels of background firing in the fixation task during the period before stimulus onset. This background activity was increased in the peripheral attention and memory-guided saccade tasks during the period when the monkey was waiting for a behaviorally relevant stimulus to appear. 8. The results from these several tasks indicate that LIP neurons are activated in a variety of circumstances and are not involved exclusively in sensory processing or motor planning. The modulation of sensory responses by attention and anticipation suggests that cognitive factors play a major role in parietal function."</span>

Therefore, we explored the activities of simvastatin, a lipophilic statin, in a Th1-driven model of murine inflammatory arthritis. We report in this study that simvastatin markedly inhibited not only developing but also clinically evident collagen-induced arthritis in doses that were unable to significantly alter cholesterol concentrations in vivo. Ex vivo analysis demonstrated significant suppression of collagen-specific Th1 humoral and cellular immune responses. Moreover, simvastatin reduced anti-CD3/anti-CD28 proliferation and IFN-γ release from mononuclear cells derived from peripheral blood and synovial fluid. Proinflammatory cytokine production in vitro by T cell contact-activated macrophages was suppressed by simvastatin, suggesting that such observations have direct clinical relevance.

Glycation, the hallmark of diabetes, is a prevalent NECM associated with an array of pathologies. Histone proteins are particularly susceptible to NECMs due to their long half-lives and nucleophilic disordered tails that undergo extensive regulatory modifications; however, histone NECMs remain poorly understood. Here we perform a detailed analysis of histone glycation in vitro and in vivo and find it has global ramifications on histone enzymatic PTMs, the assembly and stability of nucleosomes, and chromatin architecture. Importantly, we identify a physiologic regulation mechanism, the enzyme DJ-1, which functions as a potent histone deglycase. Finally, we detect intense histone glycation and DJ-1 overexpression in breast cancer tumors. Collectively, our results suggest an additional mechanism for cellular metabolic damage through epigenetic perturbation, with implications in pathogenesis."</span>

Carlton et al. (p. 220 , published online 15 March; see the Perspective by Petronczki and Uhlmann ) report that ESCRT-III modulates abscission timing through one of its subunits, CHMP4C. Depletion of CHMP4C results in faster resolution of the midbody, the cytoplasmic bridge that connects the daughter cells at the end of cytokinesis. This phenotype correlates with a differential spatiotemporal distribution of CHMP4C at the midbody. As CHMP4C is essential for activating the Aurora B–mediated abscission checkpoint, consequently, depletion of CHMP4C results in the accumulation of genetic damage.

Baseline measurements of insulin resistance and related variables were made between 1988–1995 in 208 apparently healthy, nonobese (body mass index &amp;lt; 30 kg/m2) individuals, who were then evaluated 4–11 yr later (mean ± sem = 6.3 ± 0.2 yr) for the appearance of the following age-related diseases: hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. The effect of insulin resistance on the development of clinical events was evaluated by dividing the study group into tertiles of insulin resistance at baseline and comparing the events in these 3 groups. Clinical endpoints (n = 40) were identified in 37 individuals (18%) of those evaluated, including 12 with hypertension, 3 with hypertension + type 2 diabetes, 9 with cancer, 7 with coronary heart disease, 4 with stroke, and 2 with type 2 diabetes. Twenty-eight out of the total 40 clinical events were seen in 25 individuals (36%) in the most insulin-resistant tertile, with the other 12 occurring in the group with an intermediate degree of insulin resistance. Furthermore, insulin resistance was an independent predictor of all clinical events, using both multiple logistic regression and Cox’s proportional hazards analysis. The fact that an age-related clinical event developed in approximately 1 out of 3 healthy individuals in the upper tertile of insulin resistance at baseline, followed for an average of 6 yr, whereas no clinical events were observed in the most insulin-sensitive tertile, should serve as a strong stimulus to further efforts to define the role of insulin resistance in the genesis of age-related diseases."</span>

When this is successful, they migrate to the medulla and are exposed to tissue-specific antigens (TSA) for purposes of central tolerance, and they undergo maturation to become functionally responsive T cells. It is commonly understood that thymocytes spend up to 2 wk in the medulla undergoing these final maturation steps before emigrating to peripheral lymphoid tissues. In addition, emigration is thought to occur via a stochastic mechanism whereby some progenitors leave early and others leave late—a so-called “lucky dip” process. However, recent research has revealed that medullary thymocytes are a heterogeneous mix of naive αβ T cell precursors, memory T cells, natural killer T cells, and regulatory T cells. Given this, we revisited the question of how long it takes naive αβ T cell precursors to emigrate. We combined the following three approaches to study this question: BrdU labeling, intrathymic injection of a cellular tag, and RAG2p-GFP reporter mice. We established that, on average, naive αβ T cell precursors emigrate only 4–5 d after becoming single-positive (SP) thymocytes.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Acidic extracellular pH (pHe) is a typical attribute of a tumor microenviroment, which has an impact on cancer development and treatment outcome. It was believed to result from an accumulation of lactic acid excessively produced by glycolysis. However, metabolic profiles of glycolysis‐impaired tumors have revealed that CO 2 is a significant source of acidity, thereby indicating a contribution of carbonic anhydrase (CA). The tumor‐associated CA IX isoform is the best candidate, because its extracellular enzyme domain is highly active, expression is induced by hypoxia and correlates with poor prognosis. This study provides the first evidence for the role of CA IX in the control of pHe. We show that CA IX can acidify the pH of the culture medium in hypoxia but not in normoxia. This acidification can be perturbed by deletion of the enzyme active site and inhibited by CA IX‐selective sulfonamides, which bind only to hypoxic cells containing CA IX. Our findings suggest that hypoxia regulates both expression and activity of CA IX in order to enhance the extracellular acidification, which may have important implications for tumor progression."</span>

However, direct evidence for such activity in situ is lacking. Here, we used whole-mount labeling and clearing, three-dimensional (3D) light sheet microscopy and digital image reconstruction supplemented by 2D multiparameter immunofluorescence, for in situ analyses of potential MDSC–T cell interactions in primary human head and neck cancer tissue. We could identify intratumoral hotspots of high polymorphonuclear (PMN)–MDSC and T cell colocalization. In these areas, the expression of effector molecules Granzyme B and Ki67 in T cells was strongly reduced, in particular for T cells that were in close proximity or physically engaged with PMN-MDSC, which expressed LOX-1 and arginase I. Patients with cancer with evidence for strong down-regulation of T cell function by PMN-MDSC had significantly impaired survival.

The use of fluorescent probes has become an essential method for intracellular pH detection, but existing fluorescent probes have substantial limitations, such as requiring tedious synthetic preparation, suffering from an inappropriate response range and insufficiently long emission wavelength. In this work, a red emissive two‐photon fluorescence probe based on carbon dots (pH‐CDs) is fabricated using a facile one‐pot hydrothermal method for the monitoring of intracellular pH. pH‐CDs possess a variety of superior properties, including high selectivity, excellent photostability, and low cytotoxicity. Furthermore, they exhibit a pH‐sensitive response in the range of 1.0–9.0 and a linear range of 3.5–6.5, which is desirable for tracking the pH value in living cells. It is demonstrated that the pH‐dependent fluorescence signal is regulated via switching between aggregation and disaggregation of CDs. More importantly, pH‐CDs can be successfully applied to sense and visualize pH fluctuation in cells, tissue, and zebrafish. These findings suggest that the as‐prepared pH‐CDs probe has significant potential for practical application in living systems."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"PURPOSE Even though fluorouracil (5FU) remains the standard treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, almost 90% of patients treated with 5FU alone do not achieve an objective response to chemotherapy. Biochemical modulation of 5FU by methotrexate (MTX) is an attempt to increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to 5FU. However, despite the inclusion of several hundreds of patients in randomized clinical trials, no definitive evidence is available on the clinical benefit of 5FU/MTX over 5FU alone. A meta-analysis was performed to assess this benefit objectively and quantitatively for tumor response rate and overall survival. DESIGN The meta-analysis was based on individual data of 1,178 patients included in eight randomized clinical trials comparing 5FU alone with 5FU/MTX. Patient data were provided by all principal investigators. The analyses were performed by an independent secretariat, and then discussed with all collaborators. RESULTS Tumor response rate was 10% for patients allocated to 5FU alone (complete response [CR] rate, 2%; partial response [PR] rate, 8%) compared with 19% for patients allocated to 5FU/MTX (CR rate, 3%; PR rate, 16%). This difference was highly significant, with an overall response odds ratio (OR) of 0.51 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.70) (P &lt; .0001). Median overall survival times were 9.1 months and 10.7 months in the 5FU-alone and 5FU/MTX groups, respectively. This difference was also statistically significant, with an overall survival OR of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.98) (P = .024). Logistic regression model and Cox regression model showed that performance status and randomized treatment were the only two significant predictors of tumor response and survival. CONCLUSION It is concluded that the modulation of 5FU by MTX doubles the response rate to 5FU, and yields a small improvement in survival."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is a neurotoxin that causes parkinsonism in humans and nonhuman animals, and its use has led to greater understanding of the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease. However, its molecular targets have not been defined. We show that mice lacking the gene for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which catalyzes the attachment of ADP ribose units from NAD to nuclear proteins after DNA damage, are dramatically spared from MPTP neurotoxicity. MPTP potently activates PARP exclusively in vulnerable dopamine containing neurons of the substantia nigra. MPTP elicits a novel pattern of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins that completely depends on neuronally derived nitric oxide. Thus, NO, DNA damage, and PARP activation play a critical role in MPTP-induced parkinsonism and suggest that inhibitors of PARP may have protective benefit in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The ROP18 kinase has been identified as a key virulence determinant conferring a high mortality phenotype characteristic of type I Toxoplasma gondii strains. This major effector molecule is secreted by the rhoptries into the host cells during invasion; however, the molecular mechanisms by which this kinase exerts its pathogenic action remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that ROP18 targets the host endoplasmic reticulum–bound transcription factor ATF6β. Disruption of the ROP18 gene severely impairs acute toxoplasmosis by the type I RH strain. Because another virulence factor ROP16 kinase modulates immune responses through its N-terminal portion, we focus on the role of the N terminus of ROP18 in the subversion of host cellular functions. The N-terminal extension of ROP18 contributes to ATF6β-dependent pathogenicity by interacting with ATF6β and destabilizing it. The kinase activity of ROP18 is essential for proteasome-dependent degradation of ATF6β and for parasite virulence. Consistent with a key role for ATF6β in resistance against this intracellular pathogen, ATF6β-deficient mice exhibit a high susceptibility to infection by ROP18-deficient parasites. The results reveal that interference with ATF6β-dependent immune responses is a novel pathogenic mechanism induced by ROP18."</span>

This aphotic ecosystem is anoxic and consists of a slightly acidic (pH 6.2) sodium chloride-dominated brine. Expeditions in 2005 and 2010 were conducted to investigate the biogeochemistry of Lake Vida’s brine system. A phylogenetically diverse and metabolically active Bacteria dominated microbial assemblage was observed in the brine. These bacteria live under very high levels of reduced metals, ammonia, molecular hydrogen (H 2 ), and dissolved organic carbon, as well as high concentrations of oxidized species of nitrogen (i.e., supersaturated nitrous oxide and ∼1 mmol⋅L −1 nitrate) and sulfur (as sulfate). The existence of this system, with active biota, and a suite of reduced as well as oxidized compounds, is unusual given the millennial scale of its isolation from external sources of energy. The geochemistry of the brine suggests that abiotic brine-rock reactions may occur in this system and that the rich sources of dissolved electron acceptors prevent sulfate reduction and methanogenesis from being energetically favorable. The discovery of this ecosystem and the in situ biotic and abiotic processes occurring at low temperature provides a tractable system to study habitability of isolated terrestrial cryoenvironments (e.g., permafrost cryopegs and subglacial ecosystems), and is a potential analog for habitats on other icy worlds where water-rock reactions may cooccur with saline deposits and subsurface oceans."</span>

A previous study showed that serum Mac‐2BP was significantly higher (∼2‐fold) in men with prostate cancer compared to healthy men. We investigated whether serum Mac‐2BP could distinguish men with high grade, large volume prostate cancer from men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). METHODS A commercially available ELISA kit was used to measure Mac‐2BP in paired pre‐ and post‐prostatectomy sera from 10 men with high grade, large volume prostate cancer, in pre‐operative sera from 50 untreated men with high grade, large volume prostate cancer, and in sera from 50 men with clinical symptoms of BPH and biopsy‐negative for prostate cancer. Results were analyzed by Student's t ‐test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS Levels of Mac‐2BP did not decrease in post‐prostatectomy sera, and Mac‐2BP values were not significantly different in the sera of men with prostate cancer versus those with BPH. CONCLUSION Serum Mac‐2BP does not appear to originate in the prostate and it is unlikely that Mac‐2BP can be used for the differential diagnosis of prostate cancer versus BPH.

Inactivation of certain DNA repair genes such as DNA ligase IV results in massive neuronal apoptosis and embryonic lethality in the mouse, indicating the occurrence of endogenously formed DNA double-strand breaks during nervous system development. Here we report that Atm is required for apoptosis in all areas of the DNA ligase IV-deficient developing nervous system. However, Atm deficiency failed to rescue deficits in immune differentiation in DNA ligase IV-null mice. These data indicate that ATM responds to endogenous DNA lesions and functions during development to eliminate neural cells that have incurred genomic damage.

Although it is thought that resveratrol targets Sirt1, this is controversial because resveratrol also activates 5′ AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which also regulates insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial biogenesis. Here, we use mice deficient in AMPKα1 or -α2 to determine whether the metabolic effects of resveratrol are mediated by AMPK. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Mice deficient in the catalytic subunit of AMPK (α1 or α2) and wild-type mice were fed a high-fat diet or high-fat diet supplemented with resveratrol for 13 weeks. Body weight was recorded biweekly and metabolic parameters were measured. We also used mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in AMPK to study the role of AMPK in resveratrol-mediated effects in vitro. RESULTS Resveratrol increased the metabolic rate and reduced fat mass in wild-type mice but not in AMPKα1−/− mice. In the absence of either AMPKα1 or -α2, resveratrol failed to increase insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, mitochondrial biogenesis, and physical endurance. Consistent with this, the expression of genes important for mitochondrial biogenesis was not induced by resveratrol in AMPK-deficient mice. In addition, resveratrol increased the NAD-to-NADH ratio in an AMPK-dependent manner, which may explain how resveratrol may activate Sirt1 indirectly.

Here, we describe a novel approach for targeting B lymphoma cells with doxorubicin-loaded liposomal nanoparticles displaying high-affinity glycan ligands of CD22. The targeted liposomes are actively bound and endocytosed by CD22 on B cells, and significantly extend life in a xenograft model of human B-cell lymphoma. Moreover, they bind and kill malignant B cells from peripheral blood samples obtained from patients with hairy cell leukemia, marginal zone lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Consequently, the pharmacological targeting of MDSC is emerging as a new immunotherapeutic strategy to stimulate the natural anti-tumor immune response and potentiate the efficacy of immunotherapies. Herein, we leveraged genetically modified models and a small molecule inhibitor to validate Calcium-Calmodulin Kinase Kinase 2 (CaMKK2) as a druggable target to control MDSC accumulation in tumor-bearing mice. The results indicated that deletion of CaMKK2 in the host attenuated the growth of engrafted tumor cells, and this phenomenon was associated with increased antitumor T cell response and decreased accumulation of MDSC. The adoptive transfer of MDSC was sufficient to restore the ability of the tumor to grow in Camkk2 -/- mice, confirming the key role of MDSC in the mechanism of tumor rejection. In vitro studies indicated that blocking of CaMKK2 is sufficient to impair the yield of MDSC. Surprisingly, MDSC generated from Camkk2 -/- bone marrow cells also showed a higher ability to terminally differentiate toward more immunogenic cell types (e.g inflammatory macrophages and dendritic cells) compared to wild type (WT). Higher intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated in Camkk2 -/- MDSC, increasing their susceptibility to apoptosis and promoting their terminal differentiation toward more mature myeloid cells. Mechanistic studies indicated that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a known CaMKK2 proximal target controlling the oxidative stress response, fine-tunes ROS accumulation in MDSC. Accordingly, failure to activate the CaMKK2-AMPK axis can account for the elevated ROS levels in Camkk2 -/- MDSC. These results highlight CaMKK2 as an important regulator of the MDSC lifecycle, identifying this kinase as a new druggable target to restrain MDSC expansion and enhance the efficacy of anti-tumor immunotherapy."</span>

Cell cycle and ploidy analysis upon AKI in conditional Pax8/FUCCI2aR mice and human biopsies identify endocycle-mediated hypertrophy of tubular cells. By contrast, a small subset of Pax2+ tubular progenitors enriches via higher stress resistance and clonal expansion and regenerates necrotic tubule segments, a process that can be enhanced by suitable drugs.

Remodelling is essential for parasite survival by helping to avoid host immunity and assisting in the uptake of plasma nutrients to fuel rapid growth. Host cell renovation is carried out by hundreds of parasite effector proteins that are exported into the erythrocyte across an enveloping parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM). The Plasmodium translocon for exported (PTEX) proteins is thought to span the PVM and provide a channel that unfolds and extrudes proteins across the PVM into the erythrocyte. We show that exported reporter proteins containing mouse dihydrofolate reductase domains that inducibly resist unfolding become trapped at the parasite surface partly colocalizing with PTEX. When cargo is trapped, loop‐like extensions appear at the PVM containing both trapped cargo and PTEX protein EXP2, but not additional components HSP101 and PTEX150. Following removal of the block‐inducing compound, export of reporter proteins only partly recovers possibly because much of the trapped cargo is spatially segregated in the loop regions away from PTEX. This suggests that parasites have the means to isolate unfoldable cargo proteins from PTEX‐containing export zones to avert disruption of protein export that would reduce parasite growth."</span>

These novel properties are not accounted for in the environmental risk assessment methods that the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) proposes in their guidance on environmental exposure estimation, although ENMs are already applied in a variety of consumer and industrial products. It is thus necessary to evaluate the guidance document REACH provides on environmental exposure estimation on its applicability to ENMs. This is most urgently the case for engineered nanoparticles (ENPs), as the novel properties are most often only applicable to them. The environmental fate of ENPs was reviewed and compared to the environmental fate of chemicals according to the REACH guidance. Major deviations between the fate of ENPs and predicted fate by REACH were found. They were related to at least 1 of 3 major assumptions made in REACH guidance: 1) in REACH, environmental alteration processes are all thought of as removal processes, whereas alterations of ENPs in the environment may greatly affect their properties, environmental effects, and behavior, 2) in REACH, chemicals are supposed to dissolve instantaneously and completely on release into the environment, whereas ENPs should be treated as nondissolved nanosized solids, and 3) in REACH, partitioning of dissolved chemicals to solid particles in air, water, and soil is estimated with thermodynamic equilibrium coefficients, but in the case of ENPs thermodynamic equilibrium between “dispersed” and “attached” states is generally not expected. The environmental exposure assessment of REACH therefore needs adjustment to cover the specific environmental fate of ENPs. Incorporation of the specific environmental fate processes of ENPs into the environmental risk assessment framework of REACH requires a pragmatic approach.

In one prominent system, mutants resistant to rifampicin (Rif R ; rpoB ; RNA polymerase) accumulate in cell populations that “age” on solid medium with little net growth. Mutant accumulation was initially attributed to stress-induced general mutagenesis in nongrowing cells. Evidence is presented that these Rif R mutants accumulate because they grow faster than parent cells during the aging period. Direct tests revealed no increase in the frequency of other mutant types during the aging period."</span>

This work finds that most rifampicin resistance mutations increase bacterial fitness in the environment of an ageing colony, showing that environment is a critically important determinant of relative fitness.
This study refutes the hypothesis of stress-induced mutagenesis in *E. coli* and demonstrates that rifampicin resistance accumulates due to selective growth advantages of resistant mutants, not increased mutation rates.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor controls cellular proliferation, survival, and differentiation and is functionally inactivated by mutations or hyperphosphorylation in most human cancers. Although activation of endogenous Rb is thought to provide an effective approach to suppress cell proliferation, long-term inhibition of apoptosis by active Rb may have detrimental consequences in vivo. To directly test these paradigms, we targeted phosphorylation-resistant constitutively active Rb alleles, RbΔKs, to the mouse mammary gland. Pubescent transgenic females displayed reduced ductal elongation and cell proliferation at the endbuds. Postpuberty transgenic mice exhibited precocious cellular differentiation and β-casein expression and extended survival of the mammary epithelium with a moderate but specific effect on the expression of E2F1, IGF1Rα, and phospho–protein kinase B/AKT. Remarkably, ∼30% RbΔK transgenic females developed focal hyperplastic nodules, and ∼7% exhibited full-blown mammary adenocarcinomas within 15 mo. Expression of the RbΔK transgene in these mammary tumors was reduced greatly. Our results suggest that transient activation of Rb induces cancer by extending cell survival and that the dual effects of Rb on cell proliferation and apoptosis impose an inherent caveat to the use of the Rb pathway for long-term cancer therapy."</span>

This study examined several lines of transgenic mice that express a phosphorylation-resistant (constitutively active) Rb in the mouse mammary epithelium. Some of these mice developed adenocarcinomas, indicating that constitutive Rb activity facilitates tumour development in vivo . This could be because the constitutively active form of Rb protects mammary epithelial cells from stress-induced apoptosis.
This study demonstrates the pro-oncogenic effects of long-term Rb activation in the mammary gland, showing that hyperactivation can drive tumor development despite initial growth suppression.

We characterized the tumor-infiltrating immune cells in large cohorts of human colorectal cancers by gene expression profiling and in situ immunohistochemical staining. Collectively, the immunological data (the type, density, and location of immune cells within the tumor samples) were found to be a better predictor of patient survival than the histopathological methods currently used to stage colorectal cancer. The results were validated in two additional patient populations. These data support the hypothesis that the adaptive immune response influences the behavior of human tumors.

Methods One hundred twenty‐four subjects with possible mild AD and with neuroimaging evidence of cerebrovascular disease were randomized to placebo or 250‐mg rilapladib once daily, for 24 weeks, in addition to stable background acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and/or memantine. The study assessed the safety and tolerability of rilapladib and its effects on cognition, mechanistic, and disease‐related biomarkers. Although the overall intent behind the study was to take a broad exploratory view of the data, two primary end points of interest (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] amyloid beta peptide 1–42 [Aβ 1–42 ] and CogState executive function/working memory [EF/WM] composite score at week 24) were prespecified in the analysis plan for inferential statistical analysis. Results Rilapladib was well tolerated with no significant safety concerns. A significant difference from placebo was observed for rilapladib on change from baseline in EF/WM (effect size, 0.45; P = .026). There was no significant difference between groups on the change from baseline in CSF Aβ 1–42 ( P = .133). Preliminary evidence of effects was detected on other mechanistic (albumin quotient) and disease‐related biomarkers (tau/P‐tau and neurofilament light chain).

Bdelloid proximal gene-rich regions, however, appeared to lack foreign genes, thereby resembling those of model metazoan organisms. Some of the foreign genes were defective, whereas others were intact and transcribed; some of the latter contained functional spliceosomal introns.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract We investigated the role of macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) in bleomycin-induced lung injury, a model of interstitial lung disease. Bleomycin stimulates a T cell-dependent pulmonary inflammatory response characterized by an increase in leukocyte infiltration, fibroblast proliferation, and collagen synthesis. Intratracheal challenge of CBA/J mice with bleomycin resulted in a significant time-dependent increase in MIP-1 alpha protein levels both in whole-lung homogenates and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The kinetics of MIP-1 alpha expression were biphasic, with the first peak occurring at 2 days postinstillation and the second peak at 16 days. These levels of Ag expression temporally correlated with the accumulation of granulocytes, lymphocytes, and mononuclear phagocytes in the lung. In addition, immunohistochemical staining identified alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells as the primary cellular sources of MIP-1 alpha production. Interestingly, passive immunization of bleomycin-challenged mice with anti-MIP-1 alpha Abs significantly reduced pulmonary mononuclear phagocyte accumulation and fibrosis. These experiments establish that MIP-1 alpha protein is expressed in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice and provide evidence that MIP-1 alpha promotes leukocyte accumulation and activation. Furthermore, these findings support the notion that leukocyte accumulation and activation are linked to fibrosis."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Electrophysiological methods were used to investigate the interaction of inhibitors with the human Na + /glucose (hSGLT1) and Na + /Cl − /GABA (hGAT1) cotransporters. Inhibitor constants were estimated from both inhibition of substrate‐dependent current and inhibitor‐induced changes in cotransporter conformation. The competitive, non‐transported inhibitors are substrate derivatives with inhibition constants from 200 n M (phlorizin) to 17 m M (esculin) for hSGLT1, and 300 n M (SKF89976A) to 10 m M (baclofen) for hGAT1. At least for hSGLT1, values determined using either method were proportional over 5‐orders of magnitude. Correlation of inhibition to structure of the inhibitors resulted in a pharmacophore for glycoside binding to hSGLT1: the aglycone is coplanar with the pyranose ring, and binds to a hydrophobic/aromatic surface of at least 7×12Å. Important hydrogen bond interactions occur at five positions bordering this surface. In both hSGLT1 and hGAT1 the data suggests that there is a large, hydrophobic inhibitor binding site ∼8Å from the substrate binding site. This suggests an architectural similarity between hSGLT1 and hGAT1. There is also structural similarity between non‐competitive and competitive inhibitors, e.g., phloretin is the aglycone of phlorizin (hSGLT1) and nortriptyline resembles SKF89976A without nipecotic acid (hGAT1). Our studies establish that measurement of the effect of inhibitors on presteady state currents is a valid non‐radioactive method for the determination of inhibitor binding constants. Furthermore, analysis of the presteady state currents provide novel insights into partial reactions of the transport cycle and mode of action of the inhibitors.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Diffusible chemorepellents play a major role in guiding developing axons toward their correct targets by preventing them from entering or steering them away from certain regions. Genetic studies in Drosophila revealed a repulsive guidance system that prevents inappropriate axons from crossing the central nervous system midline; this repulsive system is mediated by the secreted extracellular matrix protein Slit and its receptors Roundabout (Robo). Three distinct slit genes ( slit1 , slit2 , and slit3 ) and three distinct robo genes ( robo1 , robo2 , rig‐1 ) have been cloned in mammals. However, to date, only Robo1 and Robo2 have been shown to be receptors for Slits. In rodents, Slits have been shown to function as chemorepellents for several classes of axons and migrating neurons. In addition, Slit can also stimulate the formation of axonal branches by some sensory axons. To identify Slit‐responsive neurons and to help analyze Slit function, we have studied, by in situ hybridization, the expression pattern of slits and their receptors robo1 and robo2 , in the rat central nervous system from embryonic stages to adult age. We found that their expression patterns are very dynamic: in most regions, slit and robo are expressed in a complementary pattern, and their expression is up‐regulated postnatally. Our study confirms the potential role of these molecules in axonal pathfinding and neuronal migration. However, the persistence of robo and slit expression suggests that the couple slit/robo may also have an important function in the adult brain. J. Comp.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The genetic basis of heritable traits has been studied for decades. Although recent mapping efforts have elucidated genetic determinants of transcript levels, mapping of protein abundance has lagged. Here, we analyze levels of 4084 GFP-tagged yeast proteins in the progeny of a cross between a laboratory and a wild strain using flow cytometry and high-content microscopy. The genotype of trans variants contributed little to protein level variation between individual cells but explained &gt;50% of the variance in the population’s average protein abundance for half of the GFP fusions tested. To map trans -acting factors responsible, we performed flow sorting and bulk segregant analysis of 25 proteins, finding a median of five protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) per GFP fusion. Further, we find that cis- acting variants predominate; the genotype of a gene and its surrounding region had a large effect on protein level six times more frequently than the rest of the genome combined. We present evidence for both shared and independent genetic control of transcript and protein abundance: More than half of the expression QTLs (eQTLs) contribute to changes in protein levels of regulated genes, but several pQTLs do not affect their cognate transcript levels. Allele replacements of genes known to underlie trans eQTL hotspots confirmed the correlation of effects on mRNA and protein levels. This study represents the first genome-scale measurement of genetic contribution to protein levels in single cells and populations, identifies more than a hundred trans pQTLs, and validates the propagation of effects associated with transcript variation to protein abundance."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The growth in technological innovation that has occurred over the past decades has, in part, been possible because an increasing number of metals of the periodic table are used to perform specialized functions. However, there have been increasing concerns regarding the reliability of supply of some of these metals. A main contributor to these concerns is the fact that many of these metals are recovered only as by-products from a limited number of geopolitically concentrated ore deposits, rendering their supplies unable to respond to rapid changes in demand. Companionality is the degree to which a metal is obtained largely or entirely as a by-product of one or more host metals from geologic ores. The dependence of companion metal availability on the production of the host metals introduces a new facet of supply risk to modern technology. We evaluated companionality for 62 different metals and metalloids, and show that 61% (38 of 62) have companionality greater than 50%. Eighteen of the 38—including such technologically essential elements as germanium, terbium, and dysprosium—are further characterized as having geopolitically concentrated production and extremely low rates of end-of-life recycling. It is this subset of companion metals—vital in current technologies such as electronics, solar energy, medical imaging, energy-efficient lighting, and other state-of-the-art products—that may be at the greatest risk of supply constraints in the coming decades."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Parkinson’s disease is characterized by the presence of abnormal, intraneuronal α-synuclein aggregates, which may propagate from cell-to-cell in a prion-like manner. However, it remains uncertain where the initial α-synuclein aggregates originate. We have hypothesized that Parkinson’s disease comprises two subtypes. A brain-first (top-down) type, where α-synuclein pathology initially arises in the brain with secondary spreading to the peripheral autonomic nervous system; and a body-first (bottom-up) type, where the pathology originates in the enteric or peripheral autonomic nervous system and then spreads to the brain. We also hypothesized that isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) is a prodromal phenotype for the body-first type. Using multimodal imaging, we tested the hypothesis by quantifying neuronal dysfunction in structures corresponding to Braak stages I, II and III involvement in three distinct patient groups. We included 37 consecutive de novo patients with Parkinson’s disease into this case-control PET study. Patients with Parkinson’s disease were divided into 24 RBD-negative (PDRBD−) and 13 RBD-positive cases (PDRBD+) and a comparator group of 22 iRBD patients. We used 11C-donepezil PET/CT to assess cholinergic (parasympathetic) innervation, 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy to measure cardiac sympathetic innervation, neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to measure the integrity of locus coeruleus pigmented neurons, and 18F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (FDOPA) PET to assess putaminal dopamine storage capacity. Colon volume and transit times were assessed with CT scans and radiopaque markers. Imaging data from the three groups were interrogated with ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests corrected for multiple comparisons. The PDRBD− and PDRBD+ groups showed similar marked reductions in putaminal FDOPA-specific uptake, whereas two-thirds of iRBD patients had normal scans (P &amp;lt; 10−13, ANOVA). When compared to the PDRBD− patients, the PDRBD+ and iRBD patients showed reduced mean MIBG heart:mediastinum ratios (P &amp;lt; 10−5, ANOVA) and colon 11C-donepezil standard uptake values (P = 0.008, ANOVA). The PDRBD+ group trended towards a reduced mean MRI locus coeruleus: pons ratio compared to PDRBD− (P = 0.07, t-test). In comparison to the other groups, the PDRBD+ group also had enlarged colon volumes (P &amp;lt; 0.001, ANOVA) and delayed colonic transit times (P = 0.01, Kruskal-Wallis). The combined iRBD and PDRBD+ patient data were compatible with a body-first trajectory, characterized by initial loss of cardiac MIBG signal and 11C-colonic donepezil signal followed by loss of putaminal FDOPA uptake. In contrast, the PDRBD− data were compatible with a brain-first trajectory, characterized by primary loss of putaminal FDOPA uptake followed by a secondary loss of cardiac MIBG signal and 11C-donepezil signal. These findings support the existence of brain-first and body-first subtypes of Parkinson’s disease."</span>

To investigate the genetic basis of human specializations in brain organization and cognition, we compared gene expression profiles for the cerebral cortex of humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques by using several independent techniques. We identified 169 genes that exhibited expression differences between human and chimpanzee cortex, and 91 were ascribed to the human lineage by using macaques as an outgroup. Surprisingly, most differences between the brains of humans and non-human primates involved up-regulation, with ≈90% of the genes being more highly expressed in humans. By contrast, in the comparison of human and chimpanzee heart and liver, the numbers of up- and down-regulated genes were nearly identical. Our results indicate that the human brain displays a distinctive pattern of gene expression relative to non-human primates, with higher expression levels for many genes belonging to a wide variety of functional classes.

In this study, we questioned whether heterologous virus infections or injection with soluble protein CD4 Ags would impact this stable LCMV-specific CD4+ Thp memory pool. Limiting dilution analyses for IL-2-producing cells and intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-γ revealed that the LCMV-specific CD4+ Thp frequency remains relatively stable following multiple heterologous virus infections or protein Ag immunizations, even under conditions that dramatically reduce the LCMV-specific CD8+ CTL precursor frequency.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Covalent histone post-translational modifications such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation play pivotal roles in regulating many cellular processes, including transcription, response to DNA damage, and epigenetic control. Although positive-acting post-translational modifications have been studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , histone modifications that are associated with transcriptional repression have not been shown to occur in this yeast. Here, we provide evidence that histone sumoylation negatively regulates transcription in S. cerevisiae . We show that all four core histones are sumoylated and identify specific sites of sumoylation in histones H2A, H2B, and H4. We demonstrate that histone sumoylation sites are involved directly in transcriptional repression. Further, while histone sumoylation occurs at all loci tested throughout the genome, slightly higher levels occur proximal to telomeres. We observe a dynamic interplay between histone sumoylation and either acetylation or ubiquitylation, where sumoylation serves as a potential block to these activating modifications. These results indicate that sumoylation is the first negative histone modification to be identified in S. cerevisiae and further suggest that sumoylation may serve as a general dynamic mark to oppose transcription."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)3 is a major negative feedback regulator of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3-activating cytokines. Transgenic mouse studies indicate that high levels of SOCS3 in T cells result in type 2 T helper cell (Th2) skewing and lead to hypersensitivity to allergic diseases. To define the physiological roles of SOCS3 in T cells, we generated T cell–specific SOCS3 conditional knockout mice. We found that the mice lacking SOCS3 in T cells showed reduced immune responses not only to ovalbumin-induced airway hyperresponsiveness but also to Leishmania major infection. In vitro, SOCS3-deficient CD4+ T cells produced more transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and interleukin (IL)-10, but less IL-4 than control T cells, suggesting preferential Th3-like differentiation. We found that STAT3 positively regulates TGF-β1 promoter activity depending on the potential STAT3 binding sites. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that more STAT3 was recruited to the TGF-β1 promoter in SOCS3-deficient T cells than in control T cells. The activated STAT3 enhanced TGF-β1 and IL-10 expression in T cells, whereas the dominant-negative form of STAT3 suppressed these. From these findings, we propose that SOCS3 regulates the production of the immunoregulatory cytokines TGF-β1 and IL-10 through modulating STAT3 activation."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"▪ Abstract Genetic mechanisms of sex determination are unexpectedly diverse and change rapidly during evolution. We review the role of genetic conflict as the driving force behind this diversity and turnover. Genetic conflict occurs when different components of a genetic system are subject to selection in opposite directions. Conflict may occur between genomes (including paternal-maternal and parental-zygotic conflicts) or within genomes (between cytoplasmic and nuclear genes or sex chromosomes and autosomes). The sex-determining system consists of parental sex-ratio genes, parental-effect sex determiners, and zygotic sex determiners, which are subject to different selection pressures because of differences in their modes of inheritance and expression. Genetic conflict theory is used to explain the evolution of several sex-determining mechanisms, including sex chromosome drive, cytoplasmic sex-ratio distortion, and cytoplasmic male sterility in plants. Although still limited, there is growing evidence that genetic conflict could be important in the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The effect of weak selection driving genome evolution has attracted much attention in the last decade, but the task of measuring the strength of such selection is particularly difficult. A useful approach is to contrast the evolution of X-linked and autosomal genes in two closely related species in a whole-genome analysis. If the fitness effect of mutations is recessive, X-linked genes should evolve more rapidly than autosomal genes when the mutations are advantageous, and they should evolve more slowly than autosomal genes when the mutations are deleterious. We found synonymous substitutions on the X chromosome of human and chimpanzee to be less frequent than those on the autosomes. When calibrated against substitutions in the intergenic regions and pseudogenes to filter out the differences in the mutation rate and ancestral population size between X chromosomes and autosomes, X-linked synonymous substitutions are still 10% less frequent. At least 90% of the synonymous substitutions in human and chimpanzee are estimated to be deleterious, but the fitness effect is weaker than the effect of genetic drift. However, X-linked nonsynonymous substitutions are ≈30% more frequent than autosomal ones, suggesting the fixation of advantageous mutations that are recessive."</span>

Focal proliferative lesions of alveolar type II pneumocytes were observed as early as seven days after induction with doxycycline; after two months of induction, the lungs contained adenomas and adenocarcinomas, with focal invasion of the pleura at later stages. Removal of doxycycline caused a rapid fall in levels of mutant K-Ras RNA and concomitant apoptotic regression of both the early proliferative lesions and the tumors. Tumor burden was dramatically decreased by three days after withdrawal, and tumors were undetectable after one month.

Most CF mutations either reduce the number of CFTR channels at the cell surface (e.g., synthesis or processing mutations) or impair channel function (e.g., gating or conductance mutations) or both. There are currently no approved therapies that target CFTR. Here we describe the in vitro pharmacology of VX-770, an orally bioavailable CFTR potentiator in clinical development for the treatment of CF. In recombinant cells VX-770 increased CFTR channel open probability (P o ) in both the F508del processing mutation and the G551D gating mutation. VX-770 also increased Cl − secretion in cultured human CF bronchial epithelia (HBE) carrying the G551D gating mutation on one allele and the F508del processing mutation on the other allele by ≈10-fold, to ≈50% of that observed in HBE isolated from individuals without CF. Furthermore, VX-770 reduced excessive Na + and fluid absorption to prevent dehydration of the apical surface and increased cilia beating in these epithelial cultures.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Fungal and oomycete plant pathogens translocate effector proteins into host cells to establish infection. However, virulence targets and modes of action of their effectors are unknown. Effector AVR3a from potato blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans is translocated into host cells and occurs in two forms: AVR3a KI , which is detected by potato resistance protein R3a, strongly suppresses infestin 1 (INF1)-triggered cell death (ICD), whereas AVR3a EM , which evades recognition by R3a, weakly suppresses host ICD. Here we show that AVR3a interacts with and stabilizes host U-box E3 ligase CMPG1, which is required for ICD. In contrast, AVR3a KI/Y147del , a mutant with a deleted C-terminal tyrosine residue that fails to suppress ICD, cannot interact with or stabilize CMPG1. CMPG1 is stabilized by the inhibitors MG132 and epoxomicin, indicating that it is degraded by the 26S proteasome. CMPG1 is degraded during ICD. However, it is stabilized by mutations in the U-box that prevent its E3 ligase activity. In stabilizing CMPG1, AVR3a thus modifies its normal activity. Remarkably, given the potential for hundreds of effector genes in the P. infestans genome, silencing Avr3a compromises P. infestans pathogenicity, suggesting that AVR3a is essential for virulence. Interestingly, Avr3a silencing can be complemented by in planta expression of Avr3a KI or Avr3a EM but not the Avr3a KI/Y147del mutant. Our data provide genetic evidence that AVR3a is an essential virulence factor that targets and stabilizes the plant E3 ligase CMPG1, potentially to prevent host cell death during the biotrophic phase of infection."</span>

NDR1/NDR2 protein kinase is activated by phosphorylation on the activation loop phosphorylation site Ser281/Ser282 and the hydrophobic motif phosphorylation site Thr444/Thr442. Autophosphorylation of NDR is responsible for phosphorylation on Ser281/Ser282, whereas Thr444/Thr442 is targeted by an upstream kinase. Here we show that MST3, a mammalian Ste20-like protein kinase, is able to phosphorylate NDR protein kinase at Thr444/Thr442. In vitro, MST3 selectively phosphorylated Thr442 of NDR2, resulting in a 10-fold stimulation of NDR activity. MOB1A (Mps one binder 1A) protein further increased the activity, leading to a fully active kinase. In vivo, Thr442 phosphorylation after okadaic acid stimulation was potently inhibited by MST3KR, a kinase-dead mutant of MST3. Knockdown of MST3 using short hairpin constructs abolished Thr442 hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of NDR in HEK293F cells. We conclude that activation of NDR is a multistep process involving phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif site Thr444/2 by MST3, autophosphorylation of Ser281/2, and binding of MOB1A."</span>

We assessed the phylogenetic history and population structure of domestic goats by sequencing a hypervariable segment (481 bp) of the mtDNA control region from 406 goats representing 88 breeds distributed across the Old World. Phylogeographic analysis revealed three highly divergent goat lineages (estimated divergence &gt;200,000 years ago), with one lineage occurring only in eastern and southern Asia. A remarkably similar pattern exists in cattle, sheep, and pigs. These results, combined with recent archaeological findings, suggest that goats and other farm animals have multiple maternal origins with a possible center of origin in Asia, as well as in the Fertile Crescent. The pattern of goat mtDNA diversity suggests that all three lineages have undergone population expansions, but that the expansion was relatively recent for two of the lineages (including the Asian lineage). Goat populations are surprisingly less genetically structured than cattle populations. In goats only ≈10% of the mtDNA variation is partitioned among continents. In cattle the amount is ≥50%.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"In this study, we investigate how neurosteroid sensitivity of GABA A receptors (GABA A Rs) is regulated. We examined this issue in neurons of the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the rat and found that, during parturition, the GABA A Rs become insensitive to the neurosteroid allopregnanolone attributable to a shift in the balance between the activities of endogenous Ser/Thr phosphatase and PKC. In particular, a constitutive endogenous tone of oxytocin within the SON after parturition suppressed neurosteroid sensitivity of GABA A Rs via activation of PKC. Vice versa before parturition, during late pregnancy, application of exogenous oxytocin brings the GABA A Rs from a neurosteroid-sensitive mode toward a condition in which the receptors are not sensitive. This indicates that there may be an inverse causal relationship between the extent to which the GABA A R or one of its interacting proteins is phosphorylated and the neurosteroid sensitivity of the GABA A R. Neurosteroid sensitivity was not affected by changes in subunit composition of GABA A Rs known to occur concurrently in these cells."</span>

Studying the composition and ecology of bacterial ecosystems and understanding their function are of prime importance. High‐throughput sequencing technologies enable nearly comprehensive descriptions of bacterial diversity through 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons. Analyses of these communities generally rely upon taxonomic assignments through reference data bases or clustering approaches using de facto sequence similarity thresholds to identify operational taxonomic units. However, these methods often fail to resolve ecologically meaningful differences between closely related organisms in complex microbial data sets. In this paper, we describe oligotyping, a novel supervised computational method that allows researchers to investigate the diversity of closely related but distinct bacterial organisms in final operational taxonomic units identified in environmental data sets through 16S ribosomal RNA gene data by the canonical approaches. Our analysis of two data sets from two different environments demonstrates the capacity of oligotyping at discriminating distinct microbial populations of ecological importance.

Here we demonstrate that ephrin-B1 plays an intrinsic role in palatal shelf outgrowth in the mouse by regulating cell proliferation in the anterior palatal shelf mesenchyme. In ephrin-B1 heterozygous mutants, X inactivation generates ephrin-B1-expressing and -nonexpressing cells that sort out, resulting in mosaic ephrin-B1 expression. We now show that this process leads to mosaic disruption of cell proliferation and post-transcriptional up-regulation of EphB receptor expression through relief of endocytosis and degradation. The alteration in proliferation rates resulting from ectopic Eph–ephrin expression boundaries correlates with the more severe dysmorphogenesis of ephrin-B1 +/− heterozygotes that is a hallmark of CFNS.

Furthermore, Paneth cell-intrinsic MyD88 signaling limited bacterial penetration of host tissues, revealing a role for epithelial MyD88 in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Our findings establish that gut epithelia actively sense enteric bacteria and play an essential role in maintaining host-microbial homeostasis at the mucosal interface."</span>

Using MYD88-deficient mice, reference 108 shows that TLR signalling is required for the production of antimicrobial lectins, which limit infection and dissemination of Listeria monocytogenes . Reference 109 indicates that TLR signalling by Paneth cells themselves is required for the production of REG3γ and other antimicrobial peptides.
This study demonstrates that Paneth cells sense enteric bacteria through MyD88-dependent TLR activation, initiating antimicrobial responses and maintaining intestinal homeostasis.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Our perception is facilitated if we know where and when a sensory stimulus will occur. This phenomenon is accounted for by spatial and temporal orienting of attention. Whereas spatial orienting of attention has repeatedly been shown to involve spatially specific modulations of ongoing oscillations within sensory cortex, it is not clear to what extent anticipatory modulations of ongoing oscillations are involved in temporal orienting of attention. To address this, we recorded magnetoencephalography while human participants performed a tactile discrimination task. We cued participants to the left or the right hand, after which a tactile stimulus was presented at one of several fixed temporal delays. We thus assessed whether and how ongoing sensorimotor oscillations are modulated during tactile anticipation. We provide evidence for three phenomena. First, orienting to an upcoming tactile event involves a spatially specific contralateral suppression of alpha- and beta-band oscillations within sensorimotor cortex. Second, this modulation is deployed with temporal specificity, and this is more pronounced for beta-band compared with alpha-band oscillations. Third, the contralateral suppression of beta-band oscillations is associated with faster responses to subsequently presented tactile stimuli. Control measures showed that these results cannot be explained by motor planning or execution. We conclude that the modulation of ongoing oscillations within sensory cortex reflects a unifying mechanism underlying both spatial and temporal orienting of attention."</span>

Although single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) profiles RNA from cells dissociated from fresh tumors, single-nucleus RNA-Seq (snRNA-Seq) is needed to profile frozen or hard-to-dissociate tumors. Each requires customization to different tissue and tumor types, posing a barrier to adoption. Here, we have developed a systematic toolbox for profiling fresh and frozen clinical tumor samples using scRNA-Seq and snRNA-Seq, respectively. We analyzed 216,490 cells and nuclei from 40 samples across 23 specimens spanning eight tumor types of varying tissue and sample characteristics. We evaluated protocols by cell and nucleus quality, recovery rate and cellular composition. scRNA-Seq and snRNA-Seq from matched samples recovered the same cell types, but at different proportions.

The ECM has many effects beyond providing structural support. ECM proteins typically include multiple, independently folded domains whose sequences and arrangement are highly conserved. Some of these domains bind adhesion receptors such as integrins that mediate cell-matrix adhesion and also transduce signals into cells. However, ECM proteins also bind soluble growth factors and regulate their distribution, activation, and presentation to cells. As organized, solid-phase ligands, ECM proteins can integrate complex, multivalent signals to cells in a spatially patterned and regulated fashion.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Wnt signals control decisive steps in development and can induce the formation of tumors. Canonical Wnt signals control the formation of the embryonic axis, and are mediated by stabilization and interaction of β-catenin with Lef/Tcf transcription factors. An alternative branch of the Wnt pathway uses JNK to establish planar cell polarity in Drosophila and gastrulation movements in vertebrates. We describe here the vertebrate protein Diversin that interacts with two components of the canonical Wnt pathway, Casein kinase Iε (CKIε) and Axin/Conductin. Diversin recruits CKIε to the β-catenin degradation complex that consists of Axin/Conductin and GSK3β and allows efficient phosphorylation of β-catenin, thereby inhibiting β-catenin/Tcf signals. Morpholino-based gene ablation in zebrafish shows that Diversin is crucial for axis formation, which depends on β-catenin signaling. Diversin is also involved in JNK activation and gastrulation movements in zebrafish. Diversin is distantly related to Diego of Drosophila , which functions only in the pathway that controls planar cell polarity. Our data show that Diversin is an essential component of the Wnt-signaling pathway and acts as a molecular switch, which suppresses Wnt signals mediated by the canonical β-catenin pathway and stimulates signaling via JNK."</span>

Recently, it has been demonstrated that γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter, is co-released by dopamine neurons. Here, we show that GABA co-release in dopamine neurons does not use the conventional GABA-synthesizing enzymes, glutamate decarboxylases GAD65 and GAD67. Our experiments reveal an evolutionarily conserved GABA synthesis pathway mediated by aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 (ALDH1a1). Moreover, GABA co-release is modulated by ethanol (EtOH) at concentrations seen in blood alcohol after binge drinking, and diminished ALDH1a1 leads to enhanced alcohol consumption and preference. These findings provide insights into the functional role of GABA co-release in midbrain dopamine neurons, which may be essential for reward-based behavior and addiction."</span>

Through biochemical and molecular analysis of clinical material, we find that drug resistance is associated with the reactivation of BCR-ABL signal transduction in all cases examined. In six of nine patients, resistance was associated with a single amino acid substitution in a threonine residue of the Abl kinase domain known to form a critical hydrogen bond with the drug. This substitution of threonine with isoleucine was sufficient to confer STI-571 resistance in a reconstitution experiment. In three patients, resistance was associated with progressive BCR-ABL gene amplification.

To assess large networks of sensory neurons, we selectively label primary afferents with GCaMP6s in male and female C57bl/6 mice and visualize their functional responses to peripheral stimulation in vivo . We show that we are able to monitor the activity of hundreds of sensory neurons simultaneously, with sufficient sensitivity to detect, in most cases, single action potentials with a typical rise time of around 200 ms, and an exponential decay with a time constant of approximately 700 ms. With this technique we are able to characterize the responses of large populations of sensory neurons to innocuous and noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli under normal and inflammatory conditions. We demonstrate that the majority of primary afferents are polymodal with between 50–80% of thermally sensitive DRG neurons responding also to noxious mechanical stimulation. We also specifically assess the small population of peripheral cold neurons and demonstrate significant sensitization to cooling after a model of sterile and persistent inflammation, with significantly increased sensitivity already at decreases of 5°C when compared to uninflamed responses. This not only reveals interesting new insights into the (patho)physiology of the peripheral nervous system but also demonstrates the sensitivity of this imaging technique to physiological changes in primary afferents."</span>

The 46-year follow-up was subdivided into three periods (P): P1 1970–1985, P2 1986–2001 and P3 2002–2016, and patients accordingly grouped based on the year of LN diagnosis. Predictors of patient and renal survival were investigated by univariate and multivariate proportional hazards Cox regression analyses. Survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. Results A progressive increase in patient age at the time of LN diagnosis (p&lt;0.0001) and a longer time between systemic lupus erythematosus onset and LN occurrence (p&lt;0.0001) was observed from 1970 to 2016.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Human intestinal epithelial cells secrete an array of chemokines known to signal the trafficking of neutrophils and monocytes important in innate mucosal immunity. We hypothesized that intestinal epithelium may also have the capacity to play a role in signaling host adaptive immunity. The CC chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-3α/CCL20 is chemotactic for immature dendritic cells and CD45RO + T cells that are important components of the host adaptive immune system. In these studies, we demonstrate the widespread production and regulated expression of MIP-3α by human intestinal epithelium. Several intestinal epithelial cell lines were shown to constitutively express MIP-3α mRNA. Moreover, MIP-3α mRNA expression and protein production were upregulated by stimulation of intestinal epithelial cells with the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin-1α or in response to infection with the enteric bacterial pathogens Salmonella or enteroinvasive Escherichia coli. In addition, MIP-3α was shown to function as a nuclear factor-κB target gene. In vitro findings were paralleled in vivo by increased expression of MIP-3α in the epithelium of cytokine-stimulated or bacteria-infected human intestinal xenografts and in the epithelium of inflamed human colon. Mucosal T cells, other mucosal mononuclear cells, and intestinal epithelial cells expressed CCR6, the cognate receptor for MIP-3α. The constitutive and regulated expression of MIP-3α by human intestinal epithelium is consistent with a role for epithelial cell-produced MIP-3α in modulating mucosal adaptive immune responses."</span>

However, the utility of existing mouse strains can be limited by shortened life‐spans, spontaneous production of functional lymphocytes with ageing, and residual innate immunity leading to variable levels of engraftment. Mice with a deletion of the common cytokine receptor γ chain (γc) gene have reduced numbers of peripheral T and B lymphocytes, and absent natural killer cell (NK) activity. A genetic cross with a recombinase activating gene 2 (RAG2)‐deficient strain produced mice doubly homozygous for the γc and RAG2 null alleles (γc − /RAG2 − ). These mice have a stable phenotype characterized by the absence of all T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte and NK cell function. Injection of human B‐lymphoblastoid cells resulted in earlier fatal metastatic lymphoproliferative disease than in NOD/LtSz‐ scid controls. This was particularly evident in animals injected intravenously, possibly because of residual NK activity in NOD/LtSz‐ scid mice. Levels of engraftment with peripheral‐blood‐derived human lymphocytes were also increased and associated with higher CD4/CD8 ratios.

Cells treated with ZM447439 progress through interphase, enter mitosis normally, and assemble bipolar spindles. However, chromosome alignment, segregation, and cytokinesis all fail. Despite the presence of maloriented chromosomes, ZM447439-treated cells exit mitosis with normal kinetics, indicating that the spindle checkpoint is compromised. Indeed, ZM447439 prevents mitotic arrest after exposure to paclitaxel. RNA interference experiments suggest that these phenotypes are due to inhibition of Aurora B, not Aurora A or some other kinase. In the absence of Aurora B function, kinetochore localization of the spindle checkpoint components BubR1, Mad2, and Cenp-E is diminished. Furthermore, inhibition of Aurora B kinase activity prevents the rebinding of BubR1 to metaphase kinetochores after a reduction in centromeric tension. Aurora B kinase activity is also required for phosphorylation of BubR1 on entry into mitosis. Finally, we show that BubR1 is not only required for spindle checkpoint function, but is also required for chromosome alignment.

Methods Study participants had a diagnosis of scleroderma, a diagnosis of cancer, cancer, an available serum sample, and a cancer pathology specimen. Sera were tested for autoantibodies against topoisomerase I, centromere, and RNA polymerase I/III by immunoprecipitation and/or enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. Clinical and demographic characteristics were compared across autoantibody categories. Expression of RNA polymerases I and III was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using cancerous tissue from patients with anti–RNA polymerase antibodies. Results Twenty‐three patients were enrolled. Six patients tested positive for anti–RNA polymerase I/III, 5 for anti–topoisomerase I, and 8 for anticentromere, and 4 were not positive for any of these antigens. The median duration of scleroderma at cancer diagnosis differed significantly between groups (−1.2 years in the anti–RNA polymerase I/III group, +13.4 years in the anti–topoisomerase I group, +11.1 years in the anticentromere group, and +2.3 years in the group that was negative for all antigens tested) ( P = 0.027). RNA polymerase III demonstrated a robust nucleolar staining pattern in 4 of 5 available tumors from patients with antibodies to RNA polymerase I/III. In contrast, nucleolar RNA polymerase III staining was not detected in any of 4 examined tumors from the RNA polymerase antibody–negative group ( P = 0.048). Conclusion Our findings indicate that there is a close temporal relationship between the onset of cancer and scleroderma in patients with antibodies to RNA polymerase I/III, which is distinct from scleroderma patients with other autoantibody specificities.

Results Here we report an analysis of the genome sequences of the two biocontrol species Trichoderma atroviride (teleomorph Hypocrea atroviridis ) and Trichoderma virens (formerly Gliocladium virens , teleomorph Hypocrea virens ), and a comparison with Trichoderma reesei (teleomorph Hypocrea jecorina ). These three Trichoderma species display a remarkable conservation of gene order (78 to 96%), and a lack of active mobile elements probably due to repeat-induced point mutation. Several gene families are expanded in the two mycoparasitic species relative to T. reesei or other ascomycetes, and are overrepresented in non-syntenic genome regions. A phylogenetic analysis shows that T. reesei and T. virens are derived relative to T. atroviride .

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Evolutionary changes in transcriptional regulation undoubtedly play an important role in creating morphological diversity. However, there is little information about the evolutionary dynamics of cis-regulatory sequences. This study examines the functional consequence of evolutionary changes in the Endo16 promoter of sea urchins. The Endo16 gene encodes a large extracellular protein that is expressed in the endoderm and may play a role in cell adhesion. Its promoter has been characterized in exceptional detail in the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. We have characterized the structure and function of the Endo16 promoter from a second sea urchin species, Lytechinus variegatus. The Endo16 promoter sequences have evolved in a strongly mosaic manner since these species diverged ∼35 million years ago: the most proximal region (module A) is conserved, but the remaining modules (B-G) are unalignable. Despite extensive divergence in promoter sequences, the pattern of Endo16 transcription is largely conserved during embryonic and larval development. Transient expression assays demonstrate that 2.2 kb of upstream sequence in either species is sufficient to drive GFP reporter expression that correctly mimics this pattern of Endo16transcription. Reciprocal cross-species transient expression assays imply that changes have also evolved in the set of transcription factors that interact with the Endo16 promoter. Taken together, these results suggest that stabilizing selection on the transcriptional output may have operated to maintain a similar pattern of Endo16 expression in S. purpuratus and L. variegatus, despite dramatic divergence in promoter sequence and mechanisms of transcriptional regulation."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Crystallography is a powerful descriptor of the atomic structure of solid-state matter and can be applied to analyse the phenomena present in functional materials. Especially for ion diffusion – one of the main processes found in electrochemical energy storage materials – crystallography can describe and evaluate the elementary steps for the hopping of mobile species from one crystallographic site to another. By translating this knowledge into parameters and search for similar numbers in other materials, promising compounds for future energy storage materials can be identified. Large crystal structure databases like the ICSD, CSD, and PCD have accumulated millions of measured crystal structures and thus represent valuable sources for future data mining and big-data approaches. In this work we want to present, on the one hand, crystallographic approaches based on geometric and crystal-chemical descriptors that can be easily applied to very large databases. On the other hand, we want to show methodologies based on ab initio and electronic modelling which can simulate the structure features more realistically, incorporating also dynamic processes. Their theoretical background, applicability, and selected examples are presented."</span>

We found that livers from patients and mice with PDA harbor single disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) lacking expression of cytokeratin 19 (CK19) and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI). We created a mouse model to determine how these DCCs develop. Intraportal injection of immunogenic PDA cells into preimmunized mice seeded livers only with single, nonreplicating DCCs that were CK19 – and MHCI – . The DCCs exhibited an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response but paradoxically lacked both inositol-requiring enzyme 1α activation and expression of the spliced form of transcription factor XBP1 (XBP1s). Inducible expression of XBP1s in DCCs, in combination with T cell depletion, stimulated the outgrowth of macrometastatic lesions that expressed CK19 and MHCI. Thus, unresolved ER stress enables DCCs to escape immunity and establish latent metastases."</span>

Eight strains of the virus have been established experimentally during three epizootic periods. The clinical disease induced by these eight strains has been in general the same although its severity and mortality have varied. The principal features of the pathology of swine influenza are an exudative bronchitis accompanied by marked damage of the bronchial epithelium and its cilia, a peribronchial round cell infiltration, and massive pulmonary atelectasis. The latter is modified somewhat by a round cell infiltration of the alveolar walls. The lymph nodes, especially the cervical and mediastinal ones, are hyperplastic and edematous. There is usually a mild to moderate, acute splenic tumor. The mucosa of the stomach and colon is congested.

We present here a novel Aspergillus nuclear protein, LaeA, as a global regulator of secondary metabolism in this genus. Deletion of laeA ( Δ laeA ) blocks the expression of metabolic gene clusters, including the sterigmatocystin (carcinogen), penicillin (antibiotic), and lovastatin (antihypercholesterolemic agent) gene clusters. Conversely, overexpression of laeA triggers increased penicillin and lovastatin gene transcription and subsequent product formation. laeA expression is negatively regulated by AflR, a sterigmatocystin Zn 2 Cys 6 transcription factor, in a unique feedback loop, as well as by two signal transduction elements, protein kinase A and RasA. Although these last two proteins also negatively regulate sporulation, Δ laeA strains show little difference in spore production compared to the wild type, indicating that the primary role of LaeA is to regulate metabolic gene clusters."</span>

These cells do not have flagella or pili; instead, they rely on a novel motility apparatus composed of Gld and Spr proteins. SprB, a 669-kDa cell-surface adhesin, is required for efficient gliding. SprB was visualized by electron microscopy as thin 150-nm-long filaments extending from the cell surface. Fluorescence microscopy revealed movement of SprB proteins toward the poles of the cell at ∼2 μm/s. The fluorescent signals appeared to migrate around the pole and continue at the same speed toward the opposite pole along an apparent left-handed helical closed loop. Movement of SprB, and of cells, was rapidly and reversibly blocked by the addition of carbonyl cyanide m -chlorophenylhydrazone, which dissipates the proton gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane. In a gliding cell, some of the SprB protein appeared to attach to the substratum. The cell body moved forward and rotated with respect to this point of attachment. Upon reaching the rear of the cell, the attached SprB often was released from the substratum, and apparently recirculated to the front of the cell along a helical path. The results suggest a model for Flavobacterium gliding, supported by mathematical analysis, in which adhesins such as SprB are propelled along a closed helical loop track, generating rotation and translation of the cell body."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"A large number of algorithms have been developed to classify individuals into discrete populations using genetic data. Recent results show that the information used by both model-based clustering methods and principal components analysis can be summarized by a matrix of pairwise similarity measures between individuals. Similarity matrices have been constructed in a number of ways, usually treating markers as independent but differing in the weighting given to polymorphisms of different frequencies. Additionally, methods are now being developed that take linkage into account. We review several such matrices and evaluate their information content. A two-stage approach for population identification is to first construct a similarity matrix and then perform clustering. We review a range of common clustering algorithms and evaluate their performance through a simulation study. The clustering step can be performed either on the matrix or by first using a dimension-reduction technique; we find that the latter approach substantially improves the performance of most algorithms. Based on these results, we describe the population structure signal contained in each similarity matrix and find that accounting for linkage leads to significant improvements for sequence data. We also perform a comparison on real data, where we find that population genetics models outperform generic clustering approaches, particularly with regard to robustness for features such as relatedness between individuals."</span>

Recent studies demonstrated the involvement of the gut in cerebral amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathogenesis; however, the mechanisms are still not well understood. We hypothesize that the gut bears the Aβ burden prior to brain, highlighting gut–brain axis (GBA) interaction in neurodegenerative disorders. We used pre-symptomatic (6-months) and symptomatic (15-months) Tg2576 mouse model of AD compared to their age-matched littermate WT control. We identified that dysfunction of intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB), dysregulation of absorption, and vascular Aβ deposition in the IEB occur before cerebral Aβ aggregation is detectible. These changes in the GBA were associated with elevated inflammatory plasma cytokines including IL-9, VEGF and IP-10. In association with reduced cerebral myelin tight junction proteins, we identified reduced levels of systemic vitamin B12 and decrease cubilin, an intestinal B12 transporter, after the development of cerebral Aβ pathology. Lastly, we report Aβ deposition in the intestinal autopsy from AD patients with confirmed cerebral Aβ pathology that is not present in intestine from non-AD controls. Our data provide evidence that gut dysfunction occurs in AD and may contribute to its etiology. Future therapeutic strategies to reverse AD pathology may involve the early manipulation of gut physiology and its microbiota."</span>

In vitro and in vivo studies in rats and humans demonstrated that it is stable toward breakdown by all gastric, pancreatic, and intestinal brush-border membrane proteases. The peptide reacted with tissue transglutaminase, the major autoantigen in Celiac Sprue, with substantially greater selectivity than known natural substrates of this extracellular enzyme. It was a potent inducer of gut-derived human T cell lines from 14 of 14 Celiac Sprue patients.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract There are a number of problems and challenges in relating the science of epidemiology to mental retardation (MR). These relate to how MR is defined and classified and how these definitions may change over time. These as well as other differences in ascertainment sources and methods need to be considered when comparing MR prevalence over time and place. On the other hand, advances in technology also provide new and efficient methods of data collection both by data linkage and by use of web‐based methods to study rare diseases. While prevalence studies have not been individually reviewed, we have examined the range of data including recent studies relating to how prevalence differs according to age, gender, social class and ethnicity. Some problems with available etiological classification systems have been identified. Recent etiological studies, most of which use different classification systems, have been reviewed and explanations have been postulated to account for differences in results. Individual risk factors for MR are considered whilst the option of considering a population as opposed to a high risk strategy to MR prevention is raised. This might well involve improving the social milieu surrounding the occurrence of individual risk factors. The impact of biotechnological advances such as antenatal and neonatal screening and assisted reproduction on MR are discussed. The issue of how inequalities in access to technology may impact on case identification and even have the potential to further widen inequalities is raised. The importance of extending the use of epidemiological tools to study the social, health and economic burden of MR is also emphasized. However, in order to apply to MR the “prevention‐intervention‐research” cycle, which surely underpins all epidemiology, it is vital to ensure that the methodological challenges we raise are adequately addressed.

We clustered the samples based on similarities in the phylogenetic lineages that they contain and found that, surprisingly, the major environmental determinant of microbial community composition is salinity rather than extremes of temperature, pH, or other physical and chemical factors represented in our samples. We find that sediments are more phylogenetically diverse than any other environment type. Surprisingly, soil, which has high species-level diversity, has below-average phylogenetic diversity.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the master cellular energy sensor activated in conditions of energy insufficiency, has a major central role in whole-body energy homeostasis. However, whether brain AMPK metabolically modulates puberty onset remains unknown. We report here that central AMPK interplays with the puberty-activating gene, Kiss1 , to control puberty onset. Pubertal subnutrition, which delayed puberty, enhanced hypothalamic pAMPK levels, while activation of brain AMPK in immature female rats substantially deferred puberty. Virogenetic overexpression of a constitutively active form of AMPK, selectively in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC), which holds a key population of Kiss1 neurons, partially delayed puberty onset and reduced luteinizing hormone levels. ARC Kiss1 neurons were found to express pAMPK, and activation of AMPK reduced ARC Kiss1 expression. The physiological relevance of this pathway was attested by conditional ablation of the AMPKα1 subunit in Kiss1 cells, which largely prevented the delay in puberty onset caused by chronic subnutrition. Our data demonstrate that hypothalamic AMPK signaling plays a key role in the metabolic control of puberty, acting via a repressive modulation of ARC Kiss1 neurons in conditions of negative energy balance."</span>

Expression patterns were redefined using novel specific anti-FcR mAbs that revealed major differences between human and mouse systems. The in vivo roles of IgG receptors have been addressed using specific FcR knockout mice or in mice expressing a single FcR, and have demonstrated a predominant contribution of mouse activating IgG receptors FcγRIII and FcγRIV to models of autoimmunity (eg, arthritis) and allergy (eg, anaphylaxis). Novel blocking mAbs specific for these activating IgG receptors have enabled, for the first time, the investigation of their roles in vivo in wild-type mice.

These leukemias are classified either as T prolymphocytic leukemias, which occur very late in life, or as T chronic lymphocytic leukemias, which often arise in patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT) at a young age. The TCL1 oncogene is activated in these leukemias by juxtaposition to the α or β locus of the T cell receptor, caused by chromosomal translocations t(14:14)(q11:q32), t(7:14)(q35:q32), or by inversions inv(14)(q11:q32). To show that transcriptional alteration of TCL1 is causally involved in the generation of T cell neoplasia we have generated transgenic mice that carry the TCL1 gene under the transcriptional control of the p56 lck promoter element. The lck - TCL1 transgenic mice developed mature T cell leukemias after a long latency period. Younger mice presented preleukemic T cell expansions expressing TCL1 , and leukemias developed only at an older age. The phenotype of the murine leukemias is CD4 − CD8 + , in contrast to human leukemias, which are predominantly CD4 + CD8 − .

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Many potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease target amyloid-β peptides (Aβ), which are widely presumed to cause the disease. The microtubule-associated protein tau is also involved in the disease, but it is unclear whether treatments aimed at tau could block Aβ-induced cognitive impairments. Here, we found that reducing endogenous tau levels prevented behavioral deficits in transgenic mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein, without altering their high Aβ levels. Tau reduction also protected both transgenic and nontransgenic mice against excitotoxicity. Thus, tau reduction can block Aβ- and excitotoxin-induced neuronal dysfunction and may represent an effective strategy for treating Alzheimer's disease and related conditions."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Evolutionarily conserved hedgehog proteins orchestrate the patterning of embryonic tissues, and dysfunctions in their signaling can lead to tumorigenesis. In vertebrates, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is essential for nervous system development, but the mechanisms underlying its action remain unclear. Early electrical activity is another developmental cue important for proliferation, migration, and differentiation of neurons. Here we demonstrate the interplay between Shh signaling and Ca 2+ dynamics in the developing spinal cord. Ca 2+ imaging of embryonic spinal cells shows that Shh acutely increases Ca 2+ spike activity through activation of the Shh coreceptor Smoothened (Smo) in neurons. Smo recruits a heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein-dependent pathway and engages both intracellular Ca 2+ stores and Ca 2+ influx. The dynamics of this signaling are manifested in synchronous Ca 2+ spikes and inositol triphosphate transients apparent at the neuronal primary cilium. Interaction of Shh and electrical activity modulates neurotransmitter phenotype expression in spinal neurons. These results indicate that electrical activity and second-messenger signaling mediate Shh action in embryonic spinal neurons."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"During development of the nervous system, the tip of a growing axon, the growth cone (GC), must respond accurately to stimuli that direct its growth. This axonal navigation depends on extracellular concentration gradients of numerous guidance cues, including GABA. GCs can detect even weak directional signals, yet the mechanisms underlying this sensitivity remain unclear. Past studies in other eukaryotic chemotactic systems have pointed to the role of the spatial reorganization of the transduction pathway in their sensitive response. Here we have developed a single-molecule assay to observe individual GABA A receptors (GABA A Rs) in the plasma membrane of nerve GCs subjected to directional stimuli. We report that in the presence of an external GABA gradient GABA A Rs redistribute asymmetrically across the GC toward the gradient source. Single-particle tracking of GABA A Rs shows that the redistribution results from transient interactions between the receptors and the microtubules. Moreover, the relocalization is accompanied by an enhancement in the asymmetry of intracellular calcium concentration. Altogether, our results reveal a microtubule-dependent polarized reorganization of chemoreceptors at the cell surface and suggest that this polarization serves as an amplification step in GABA gradient sensing by nerve GCs."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Arsenic poisoning affects millions of people worldwide. Human arsenic intake from rice consumption can be substantial because rice is particularly efficient in assimilating arsenic from paddy soils, although the mechanism has not been elucidated. Here we report that two different types of transporters mediate transport of arsenite, the predominant form of arsenic in paddy soil, from the external medium to the xylem. Transporters belonging to the NIP subfamily of aquaporins in rice are permeable to arsenite but not to arsenate. Mutation in OsNIP2;1 (Lsi1, a silicon influx transporter) significantly decreases arsenite uptake. Furthermore, in the rice mutants defective in the silicon efflux transporter Lsi2, arsenite transport to the xylem and accumulation in shoots and grain decreased greatly. Mutation in Lsi2 had a much greater impact on arsenic accumulation in shoots and grain in field-grown rice than Lsi1. Arsenite transport in rice roots therefore shares the same highly efficient pathway as silicon, which explains why rice is efficient in arsenic accumulation. Our results provide insight into the uptake mechanism of arsenite in rice and strategies for reducing arsenic accumulation in grain for enhanced food safety."</span>

AT is characterized by cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency, chromosomal instability, cancer predisposition, radiation sensitivity, and cell cycle abnormalities. The disease is genetically heterogeneous, with four complementation groups that have been suspected to represent different genes. ATM , which has a transcript of 12 kilobases, was found to be mutated in AT patients from all complementation groups, indicating that it is probably the sole gene responsible for this disorder. A partial ATM complementary DNA clone of 5.9 kilobases encoded a putative protein that is similar to several yeast and mammalian phosphatidylinositol-3′ kinases that are involved in mitogenic signal transduction, meiotic recombination, and cell cycle control.

The precise molecular mechanisms by which endothelial cells transduce this mechanical stimulus into intracellular biochemical response have not been established. Here, we show that mechanical perturbation of the plasma membrane leads to ligand-independent conformational transitions in a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). By using time-resolved fluorescence microscopy and GPCR conformation-sensitive FRET we found that stimulation of endothelial cells with fluid shear stress, hypotonic stress, or membrane fluidizing agent leads to a significant increase in activity of bradykinin B 2 GPCR in endothelial cells. The GPCR conformational dynamics was detected by monitoring redistribution of GPCRs between inactive and active conformations in a single endothelial cell under fluid shear stress in real time. We show that this response can be blocked by a B 2 -selective antagonist. Our data demonstrate that changes in cell membrane tension and membrane fluidity affect conformational dynamics of GPCRs. Therefore, we suggest that GPCRs are involved in mediating primary mechanochemical signal transduction in endothelial cells. We anticipate our experiments to be a starting point for more sophisticated studies of the effects of changes in lipid bilayer environment on GPCR conformational dynamics. Furthermore, because GPCRs are a major target of drug development, a detailed characterization of mechanochemical signaling via the GPCR pathway will be relevant for the development of new antiatherosclerosis drugs."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Natural killer T (NKT) cells are important regulators of the immune system, but their trafficking machinery, including expression of chemokine receptors, has been poorly defined. Unlike other conventional T-cell populations, we show that most NKT cells express receptors for extralymphoid tissue or inflammation-related chemokines (CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR3), while few NKT cells express lymphoid tissue–homing chemokine receptors (CCR7 and CXCR5). A population with homing potential for lymph nodes (L selectin+ CCR7+) exists only within a small subset of CD4 NKT cells. We show differential expression of chemokine receptors among NKT cell subsets: CCR4 is mainly expressed by a high cytokine (interleukin-4/interleukin-2)–producing (CD4) NKT subset, while CCR1, CCR6, and CXCR6 are preferentially expressed by the low cytokine-producing CD8 and CD4−CD8− subsets. In line with this, TARC/CCL17 (a CCR4 ligand) induces preferential chemotaxis of the CD4 NKT subset, while chemotactic activities of LARC/CCL20 (a CCR6 ligand) and MIP-1α/CCL3 (a CCR1 ligand) are focused on the CD8 and CD4−CD8− NKT cells. We conclude that, unlike conventional naive, memory, or effector T cells, the entire NKT cell population expresses nonlymphoid tissue homing chemokine receptors, yet NKT cell subsets differ considerably from each other by displaying distinct and reciprocal expression patterns of some chemokine receptors. Our results identify chemokine receptors that are potentially important for trafficking of human blood NKT cell subsets and reveal their function (cytokine production capacity)–dependent differential trafficking potentials."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The ETS gene family is frequently involved in chromosome translocations that cause human cancer, including prostate cancer, leukemia, and sarcoma. However, the mechanisms by which oncogenic ETS proteins, which are DNA-binding transcription factors, target genes necessary for tumorigenesis is not well understood. Ewing's sarcoma serves as a paradigm for the entire class of ETS-associated tumors because nearly all cases harbor recurrent chromosomal translocations involving ETS genes. The most common translocation in Ewing's sarcoma encodes the EWS/FLI oncogenic transcription factor. We used whole genome localization (ChIP-chip) to identify target genes that are directly bound by EWS/FLI. Analysis of the promoters of these genes demonstrated a significant over-representation of highly repetitive GGAA-containing elements (microsatellites). In a parallel approach, we found that EWS/FLI uses GGAA microsatellites to regulate the expression of some of its target genes including NR0B1 , a gene required for Ewing's sarcoma oncogenesis. The microsatellite in the NR0B1 promoter bound EWS/FLI in vitro and in vivo and was both necessary and sufficient to confer EWS/FLI regulation to a reporter gene. Genome wide computational studies demonstrated that GGAA microsatellites were enriched close to EWS/FLI-up-regulated genes but not down-regulated genes. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the ability of EWS/FLI to bind DNA and modulate gene expression through these repetitive elements depended on the number of consecutive GGAA motifs. These findings illustrate an unprecedented route to specificity for ETS proteins and use of microsatellites in tumorigenesis."</span>

The technique permits the tracing of relationships back to the common ancestor of all extant life. This first glimpse of bacterial phylogeny reveals a world whose roots appear to span more than 3 billion years. A deep phylogenetic split exists among the bacteria, which necessitates their division into two major lines of descent, the archaebacteria and the true bacteria (or eubacteria). It is a general finding that the most ancient bacterial phenotypes are anaerobic, and that aerobic phenotypes have arisen a number of times. Photosynthetic phenotypes are also extremely ancient. Many nonphotosynthetic groups appear to have arisen from photosynthetic ancestry, which is reason to question the generally held belief that the first bacteria were anaerobic heterotrophs. The two ultimate lines of bacterial descent are no more closely related to one another than either is to the cytoplasmic aspect of the eukaryotic cell. However, in that the eukaryotic cell is a phylogenetic chimera, it itself cannot be seen as a line of descent comparable to the two bacterial lines—although some of its individual parts can be so viewed. In this way, the chloroplast and perhaps the mitochondrion are each eubacterial, and at least one ribosomal protein is archaebacterial. A third line of descent that is neither eubacterial nor archaebacterial is represented in the 18 S ribosomal RNA."</span>

Simultaneous extracellular recordings were obtained from neurons in ventral layer III and layer IV. Spike-triggered averaging was employed to investigate synaptic connections from neurons in layers III/IV to pyramidal cells in layer III. 2. Of 701 simultaneously recorded pairs of neurons, comprising 699 extracellularly and 128 intracellularly recorded neurons, synaptic connections were demonstrated in 30 pairs. Of these, 29 were excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and 1, an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). Single-axon EPSPs with a wide variety of amplitudes were recorded: the range recorded at membrane potentials between -68 and -72 mV was 0.079-2.3 mV. Comparing recordings obtained from different cells, EPSP amplitude was found to be independent of both the membrane resistance of the postsynaptic neuron and the EPSP time course; i.e., the largest EPSPs were not necessarily those recorded from neurons with the highest input resistance, nor those with the briefest time course. 3. Shape indices: width at half amplitude and rise-time, indicative of both proximal and distal synaptic locations were obtained. Normalized rise-times were between 0.1 and 2 times the membrane time constant and half-widths between 0.8 and 20 times. 4. The majority of postsynaptic neurons displayed nonlinear voltage relations typical of pyramidal neurons, and the contribution to EPSP shape of voltage-dependent currents was investigated. EPSP amplitude and duration were found to be dependent on membrane potential. The majority of single-axon EPSPs (26 of 29), increased in amplitude and duration with membrane depolarization over the range -95 - -50 mV, despite the significant decrease in driving force for the EPSP that would be expected to accompany such large depolarizations. This increase coincided with an increase in the amplitude of voltage responses to small injected current pulses. 5. It is concluded that the amplitude and time course of single-axon EPSPs recorded in cortical pyramidal somata are affected not only by the amplitude of the postsynaptic current and the location(s) of the synapse(s) relative to the soma, but also by voltage-dependent currents. The possibility that the increase in amplitude and duration of these EPSPs with membrane depolarization is due to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor involvement is discussed."</span>

This process, however, is only incompletely attenuated by protease inhibitor–based treatment, suggesting the existence of migratory compensation strategies. In three-dimensional collagen matrices, spindle-shaped proteolytically potent HT-1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 carcinoma cells exhibited a constitutive mesenchymal-type movement including the coclustering of β1 integrins and MT1–matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) at fiber bindings sites and the generation of tube-like proteolytic degradation tracks. Near-total inhibition of MMPs, serine proteases, cathepsins, and other proteases, however, induced a conversion toward spherical morphology at near undiminished migration rates. Sustained protease-independent migration resulted from a flexible amoeba-like shape change, i.e., propulsive squeezing through preexisting matrix gaps and formation of constriction rings in the absence of matrix degradation, concomitant loss of clustered β1 integrins and MT1-MMP from fiber binding sites, and a diffuse cortical distribution of the actin cytoskeleton. Acquisition of protease-independent amoeboid dissemination was confirmed for HT-1080 cells injected into the mouse dermis monitored by intravital multiphoton microscopy. In conclusion, the transition from proteolytic mesenchymal toward nonproteolytic amoeboid movement highlights a supramolecular plasticity mechanism in cell migration and further represents a putative escape mechanism in tumor cell dissemination after abrogation of pericellular proteolysis."</span>

We now find an Hsp104 mutation (D184N) that confers resistance to guanidine-curing of the yeast [ PSI + ] prion. In an independent screen we isolated an HSP104 allele altered in the same residue (D184Y) that dramatically impairs [ PSI + ] propagation in a temperature-dependent manner. Directed mutagenesis of HSP104 produced additional alleles that conferred varying degrees of resistance to guanidine-curing or impaired [ PSI + ] propagation. The mutations similarly affected propagation of the [ URE3 ] prion. Basal and induced abundance of all mutant proteins was normal. Thermotolerance of cells expressing mutant proteins was variably resistant to guanidine, and the degree of thermotolerance did not correlate with [ PSI + ] stability. We thus show that guanidine cures yeast prions by inactivating Hsp104 and identify a highly conserved Hsp104 residue that is critical for yeast prion propagation.

Olfr78 is expressed in the renal juxtaglomerular apparatus, where it mediates renin secretion in response to SCFAs. In addition, both Olfr78 and G protein-coupled receptor 41 (Gpr41), another SCFA receptor, are expressed in smooth muscle cells of small resistance vessels. Propionate, a SCFA shown to induce vasodilation ex vivo, produces an acute hypotensive response in wild-type mice.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Interest in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials has grown rapidly across multiple scientific and engineering disciplines in recent years. However, ferroelectricity, the presence of a spontaneous electric polarization, which is important in many practical applications, has rarely been reported in such materials so far. Here we employ first-principles calculations to discover a branch of the 2D materials family, based on In 2 Se 3 and other III 2 -VI 3 van der Waals materials, that exhibits room-temperature ferroelectricity with reversible spontaneous electric polarization in both out-of-plane and in-plane orientations. The device potential of these 2D ferroelectric materials is further demonstrated using the examples of van der Waals heterostructures of In 2 Se 3 /graphene, exhibiting a tunable Schottky barrier, and In 2 Se 3 /WSe 2 , showing a significant band gap reduction in the combined system. These findings promise to substantially broaden the tunability of van der Waals heterostructures for a wide range of applications."</span>

The crystal structure of the three domains comprising the ectoplasmic region of the antigen from P. vivax , solved at 1.8 angstrom resolution, shows that domains I and II belong to the PAN motif, which defines a superfamily of protein folds implicated in receptor binding. We also mapped the epitope of an invasion-inhibitory monoclonal antibody specific for the P. falciparum ortholog and modeled this to the structure. The location of the epitope and current knowledge on structure-function correlations for PAN domains together suggest a receptor-binding role during invasion in which domain II plays a critical part. These results are likely to aid vaccine and drug design."</span>

The technologies in smartphones allow citizens to act as sensors of their environment, producing and sharing rich spatial data useful for new types of collaborative governance set-ups. Data derived from Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) can support accessible, transparent, democratic, inclusive, and locally-based governance situations of interest to planners, citizens, politicians, and scientists. However, there are still uncertainties about how to actually conduct this in practice. This study explores how social media VGI can be used to document spatial tendencies regarding citizens’ uses and perceptions of urban nature with relevance for urban green space governance. Via the hashtag &lt;em&gt;#sharingcph&lt;/em&gt;, created by the City of Copenhagen in 2014, VGI data consisting of geo-referenced images were collected from Instagram, categorised according to their content and analysed according to their spatial distribution patterns. The results show specific spatial distributions of the images and main hotspots. Many possibilities and much potential of using VGI for generating, sharing, visualising and communicating knowledge about citizens’ spatial uses and preferences exist, but as a tool to support scientific and democratic interaction, VGI data is challenged by practical, technical and ethical concerns.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"A striking feature of the circadian clock is its flexible yet robust response to various environmental conditions. To analyze the biochemical processes underlying this flexible-yet-robust characteristic, we examined the effects of 1,260 pharmacologically active compounds in mouse and human clock cell lines. Compounds that markedly (&gt;10 s.d.) lengthened the period in both cell lines, also lengthened it in central clock tissues and peripheral clock cells. Most compounds inhibited casein kinase Iε (CKIε) or CKIδ phosphorylation of the PER2 protein. Manipulation of CKIε/δ-dependent phosphorylation by these compounds lengthened the period of the mammalian clock from circadian (24 h) to circabidian (48 h), revealing its high sensitivity to chemical perturbation. The degradation rate of PER2, which is regulated by CKIε/δ-dependent phosphorylation, was temperature-insensitive in living clock cells, yet sensitive to chemical perturbations. This temperature-insensitivity was preserved in the CKIε/δ-dependent phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide in vitro. Thus, CKIε/δ-dependent phosphorylation is likely a temperature-insensitive period-determining process in the mammalian circadian clock."</span>

We reconstituted internal ribosomal entry in vitro from purified translation components and monitored assembly of 48S ribosomal preinitiation complexes by toe-printing. Ribosomal subunits (40S) formed stable binary complexes on both mRNAs. The complex structure of these RNAs determined the correct positioning of the initiation codon in the ribosomal “P” site in binary complexes. Ribosomal binding and positioning on these mRNAs did not require the initiation factors eIF3, eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4F and translation of these mRNAs was not inhibited by a trans -dominant eIF4A mutant. Addition of Met–tRNA i Met , eIF2, and GTP to these binary ribosomal complexes resulted in formation of 48S preinitiation complexes.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Determining the genome sequence of an organism is challenging, yet fundamental to understanding its biology. Over the past decade, thousands of human genomes have been sequenced, contributing deeply to biomedical research. In the vast majority of cases, these have been analyzed by aligning sequence reads to a single reference genome, biasing the resulting analyses, and in general, failing to capture sequences novel to a given genome. Some de novo assemblies have been constructed free of reference bias, but nearly all were constructed by merging homologous loci into single “consensus” sequences, generally absent from nature. These assemblies do not correctly represent the diploid biology of an individual. In exactly two cases, true diploid de novo assemblies have been made, at great expense. One was generated using Sanger sequencing, and one using thousands of clone pools. Here, we demonstrate a straightforward and low-cost method for creating true diploid de novo assemblies. We make a single library from ∼1 ng of high molecular weight DNA, using the 10x Genomics microfluidic platform to partition the genome. We applied this technique to seven human samples, generating low-cost HiSeq X data, then assembled these using a new “pushbutton” algorithm, Supernova. Each computation took 2 d on a single server. Each yielded contigs longer than 100 kb, phase blocks longer than 2.5 Mb, and scaffolds longer than 15 Mb. Our method provides a scalable capability for determining the actual diploid genome sequence in a sample, opening the door to new approaches in genomic biology and medicine."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Adiposity is an established risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer. Recent data suggest that high insulin levels in overweight women may play a major role in this relationship, due to insulin's mitogenic/antiapoptotic activity. However, whether overweight women who are metabolically healthy (i.e., normal insulin sensitivity) have elevated risk of breast cancer is unknown. We investigated whether overweight women with normal insulin sensitivity [i.e., homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, or fasting insulin level, within the lowest quartile (q1)] have increased breast cancer risk. Subjects were incident breast cancer cases (N = 497) and a subcohort (N = 2,830) of Women's Health Initiative (WHI) participants with available fasting insulin and glucose levels. In multivariate Cox models, metabolically healthy overweight women, defined using HOMA-IR, were not at elevated risk of breast cancer compared with metabolically healthy normal weight women [HRHOMA-IR, 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.64–1.42]. In contrast, the risk among women with high (q3-4) HOMA-IRs was elevated whether they were overweight (HRHOMA-IR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.19-2.60) or normal weight (HRHOMA-IR, 1.80; 95% CI, 0.88–3.70). Similarly, using fasting insulin to define metabolic health, metabolically unhealthy women (insulin q3-4) were at higher risk of breast cancer regardless of whether they were normal weight (HRinsulin, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.01–4.22) or overweight (HRinsulin, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.35–2.99), whereas metabolically healthy overweight women did not have significantly increased risk of breast cancer (HRinsulin, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.64–1.42) relative to metabolically healthy normal weight women. Metabolic health (e.g., HOMA-IR or fasting insulin) may be more biologically relevant and more useful for breast cancer risk stratification than adiposity per se.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The microenvironment of the cochlea is maintained by the barrier between the systemic circulation and the fluids inside the stria vascularis. However, the mechanisms that control the permeability of the intrastrial fluid–blood barrier remain largely unknown. The barrier comprises endothelial cells connected to each other by tight junctions and an underlying basement membrane. In a recent study, we found that the intrastrial fluid–blood barrier also includes a large number of perivascular cells with both macrophage and melanocyte characteristics. The perivascular-resident macrophage-like melanocytes (PVM/Ms) are in close contact with vessels through cytoplasmic processes. Here we demonstrate that PVM/Ms have an important role in maintaining the integrity of the intrastrial fluid–blood barrier and hearing function. Using a cell culture-based in vitro model and a genetically induced PVM/M-depleted animal model, we show that absence of PVM/Ms increases the permeability of the intrastrial fluid–blood barrier to both low- and high-molecular-weight tracers. The increased permeability is caused by decreased expression of pigment epithelial-derived factor, which regulates expression of several tight junction-associated proteins instrumental to barrier integrity. When tested for endocochlear potential and auditory brainstem response, PVM/M-depleted animals show substantial drop in endocochlear potential with accompanying hearing loss. Our results demonstrate a critical role for PVM/Ms in regulating the permeability of the intrastrial fluid–blood barrier for establishing a normal endocochlear potential hearing threshold."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"In a recent study, a large proportion of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii strains that were isolated from hospitalized patients in the Czech Republic was found to belong to two major groups (A and B). These groups appeared to be similar to epidemic clones I and II, respectively, which were identified previously among outbreak strains from north-western European hospitals. The aim of the present study was to assess in detail the genetic relatedness of Czech A. baumannii strains and those of epidemic clones I and II by using ribotyping with Hin dIII and Hin cII and by AFLP fingerprinting. The study collection included 70 MDR strains that were isolated in 30 Czech hospitals in 1991–2001, 15 susceptible Czech strains from 1991 to 1996 and 13 reference strains of clones I and II from 1982 to 1990. One major Hin dIII/ Hin cIII ribotype ( R1 - 1 ) was observed in 38 MDR Czech strains and eight reference strains of clone I, whereas another major ribotype ( R2 - 2 ) was observed in 11 MDR Czech strains and in three reference strains of clone II. A selection of 59 Czech strains (representative of all ribotypes) and the 13 reference strains were investigated by AFLP fingerprinting. At a clustering level of 83 %, two large clusters could be distinguished: cluster 1 included all reference strains of clone I and 25 MDR Czech strains, whilst cluster 2 contained all reference strains of clone II and 11 MDR Czech strains. There was a clear correlation between the groupings by AFLP analysis and by ribotyping, as all strains with ribotype R1 - 1 and four strains with slightly different ribotypes were found in AFLP cluster 1, whereas all strains with ribotype R2 - 2 and seven strains with similar ribotypes were in AFLP cluster 2. Thus, 41 and 21 MDR Czech strains could be classified as belonging to clones I and II, respectively. The remaining eight MDR and 15 susceptible strains were highly heterogeneous and were distinct from clones I and II by both AFLP fingerprinting and ribotyping. These results indicate that the two predominant groups observed among MDR Czech A. baumannii strains from the 1990s are genetically congruent with the north-western European epidemic clones that were found in the 1980s. Recognition of these clinically relevant, widespread clones is important in infection prevention and control; they are also interesting subjects to study genetic mechanisms that give rise to their antibiotic resistance and epidemic behaviour."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Bidirectional transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm occurs through the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) by a signal-mediated mechanism that is directed by targeting signals (NLSs) residing on the transported molecules or “cargoes.” Nuclear transport starts after interaction of the targeting signal with soluble cellular receptors. After the formation of the cargo-receptor complex in the cytosol, this complex crosses the NPC. Herein, we use gold particles of various sizes coated with cargo-receptor complexes to determine precisely how large macromolecules crossing the NPC by the signal-mediated transport mechanism could be. We found that cargo-receptor-gold complexes with diameter close to 39 nm could be translocated by the NPC. This implies that macromolecules much larger than the assumed functional NPC diameter of 26 nm can be transported into the karyoplasm. The physiological relevance of this finding was supported by the observation that intact nucleocapsids of human hepatitis B virus with diameters of 32 and 36 nm are able to cross the nuclear pore without disassembly."</span>

The first stimulation paradigm, primed burst (PB) stimulation, consisted of a total of five physiologically patterned stimuli: a single priming pulse followed 170 ms later by a burst of four pulses at 200 Hz. The second stimulation paradigm, long‐term potentiation (LTP) stimulation, consisted of a 200 Hz/1 second train (a total of 200 stimuli). Primed burst and LTP stimulation were equally effective at inducing a lasting increase in the population spike recorded from slices made from young rats. However, the enhancement of population spike amplitude produced by PB, but not LTP, stimulation was significantly less in slices made from old rats. These results suggest that the capacity of the hippocampus to demonstrate long‐lasting synaptic plasticity is not altered with age, but that engaging plasticity‐inducing mechanisms becomes more difficult. Furthermore, these data suggest that physiologically patterned paradigms for inducing long‐lasting synaptic plasticity may more accurately assess the functional status of hippocampal memory encoding mechanisms than does conventional LTP stimulation."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The mechanism by which substrates for endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation are retrotranslocated to the cytosol remains largely unknown, although ubiquitination is known to play a key role. The mouse γ-herpesvirus protein mK3 is a viral RING-CH–type E3 ligase that specifically targets nascent major histocompatibility complex I heavy chain (HC) for degradation, thus blocking the immune detection of virus-infected cells. To address the question of how HC is retrotranslocated and what role mK3 ligase plays in this action, we investigated ubiquitin conjugation sites on HC using mutagenesis and biochemistry approaches. In total, our data demonstrate that mK3-mediated ubiquitination can occur via serine, threonine, or lysine residues on the HC tail, each of which is sufficient to induce the rapid degradation of HC.

Its energy supply comes from chemical sources, due to fluids that migrate upward from deeper levels in the Earth. In mass and volume it may be comparable with all surface life. Such microbial life may account for the presence of biological molecules in all carbonaceous materials in the outer crust, and the inference that these materials must have derived from biological deposits accumulated at the surface is therefore not necessarily valid.

This result was established by measuring the ability of coculture conditioned medium (formed with or without Man-6-P or anti-Man-6-PR) to suppress bovine aortic endothelial cell migration and protease production, activities previously shown to be related to transforming growth factor beta activity. The inhibition by Man-6-P is dose dependent, with maximal inhibition seen at 100 microM and is specific because mannose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate do not interfere with activation of LTGF-beta. The inhibitory effect of anti-Man-6-PR is also specific and dose dependent; maximal inhibition of activation occurs at 400 micrograms/ml. Control experiments indicate that Man-6-P and anti-Man-6-PR do not interfere with the basal level of migration of bovine aortic endothelial cells, the migration observed when exogenous transforming growth factor beta is added, the activation of transforming growth factor beta by plasmin or transient acidification, and the release of LTGF-beta.

Understanding the origin of this link is of great interest because it could offer access to a new diagnostic tool for investigating tissue microstructure. Since it has been suggested that myelin is the dominant source of this contrast, creating an accurate model for characterizing the effect of the myelin sheath on the evolution of the NMR signal is an essential step toward fully understanding WM contrast. In this study, we show by comparison of the results of simulations and experiments carried out on human subjects at 7T, that the magnitude and phase of signals acquired from WM in vivo can be accurately characterized by ( i ) modeling the myelin sheath as a hollow cylinder composed of material having an anisotropic magnetic susceptibility that is described by a tensor with a radially oriented principal axis, and ( ii ) adopting a two-pool model in which the water in the sheath has a reduced T 2 relaxation time and spin density relative to its surroundings, and also undergoes exchange.

Our analysis reveals similarity of chromosomal arm-level alterations among developmentally related tumor types as well as a number of co-occurring pairs of arm-level alterations. Recurrent (“pan-lineage”) focal alterations identified across diverse tumor types show an enrichment of known cancer-related genes and genes with relevant functions in cancer-associated phenotypes (e.g., kinase and cell cycle). Tumor type-specific (“lineage-restricted”) alterations and their enriched functional categories were also identified. Furthermore, we developed an algorithm for detecting regions in which the copy number oscillates rapidly between fixed levels, indicative of chromothripsis. We observed these massive genomic rearrangements in 1%–2% of the samples with variable tumor type-specific incidence rates.

Here, we study the evolutionary trend of alternative splicing after gene duplication by analyzing the alternative splicing differences between duplicate genes. We observed that duplicate genes have fewer alternative splice (AS) forms than single-copy genes, and that a negative correlation exists between the mean number of AS forms and the gene family size. Interestingly, we found that the loss of alternative splicing in duplicate genes may occur shortly after the gene duplication. These results support the subfunctionization model of alternative splicing in the early stage after gene duplication. Further analysis of the alternative splicing distribution in human duplicate pairs showed the asymmetric evolution of alternative splicing after gene duplications; i.e., the AS forms between duplicates may differ dramatically. We therefore conclude that alternative splicing and gene duplication may not evolve independently. In the early stage after gene duplication, young duplicates may take over a certain amount of protein function diversity that previously was carried out by the alternative splicing mechanism. In the late stage, the gain and loss of alternative splicing seem to be independent between duplicates."</span>

Which summary for this paper do you think is written by human authors?
[[Choices]]
References 59 and 60 show a significant inverse correlation between the frequency of alternative splicing and the size of a multigene family, suggesting that gene duplication was frequently followed by the loss of alternative splicing.
This study indicates that early after gene duplication, alternative splicing is downregulated and function is shifted to the paralogs.

Here we report that mice lacking UBP43, a protease that removes ISG15 from ISGylated proteins, are hypersensitive to type I IFN. Most importantly, in UBP43-deficient cells, IFN-β induces a prolonged Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation, DNA binding, and IFN-mediated gene activation. Furthermore, restoration of ISG15 conjugation in protein ISGylation-defective K562 cells increases IFN-stimulated promoter activity. These findings identify UBP43 as a novel negative regulator of IFN signaling and suggest the involvement of protein ISGylation in the regulation of the JAK-STAT pathway."</span>

However, the proliferation rate is low in many chemosensitive human cancers, and it is not clear how a drug that only kills dividing cells could promote tumor regression. Four potential solutions to this “proliferation rate paradox” are discussed for the microtubule-stabilizing drug paclitaxel: drug retention in tumors, killing of quiescent cells, targeting of noncancer cells in the tumor, and bystander effects. Testing these potential mechanisms of drug action will facilitate rational improvement of antimitotic chemotherapy and perhaps cytotoxic chemotherapy more generally."</span>

We concentrate here on five species of Saccharomycetaceae , a large subdivision of hemiascomycetes, that we call “protoploid” because they diverged from the S. cerevisiae lineage prior to its genome duplication. We determined the complete genome sequences of three of these species: Kluyveromyces (Lachancea) thermotolerans and Saccharomyces (Lachancea) kluyveri (two members of the newly described Lachancea clade), and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii . We included in our comparisons the previously available sequences of Kluyveromyces lactis and Ashbya ( Eremothecium) gossypii . Despite their broad evolutionary range and significant individual variations in each lineage, the five protoploid Saccharomycetaceae share a core repertoire of approximately 3300 protein families and a high degree of conserved synteny. Synteny blocks were used to define gene orthology and to infer ancestors. Far from representing minimal genomes without redundancy, the five protoploid yeasts contain numerous copies of paralogous genes, either dispersed or in tandem arrays, that, altogether, constitute a third of each genome. Ancient, conserved paralogs as well as novel, lineage-specific paralogs were identified."</span>

However, neither the normal function of ATM in the nervous system nor the biological basis of the degeneration in AT is known. Resistance to apoptosis in the developing central nervous system (CNS) of Atm −/− mice was observed after ionizing radiation. This lack of death occurred in diverse regions of the CNS, including the cerebellum, which is markedly affected in AT. In wild-type, but not Atm −/− mice, up-regulation of p53 coincided with cell death, suggesting that Atm-dependent apoptosis in the CNS is mediated by p53. Further, p53 null mice showed a similar lack of radiation-induced cell death in the developing nervous system.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Ark1p (actin regulating kinase 1) was identified as a yeast protein that binds to Sla2p, an evolutionarily conserved cortical actin cytoskeleton protein. Ark1p and a second yeast protein, Prk1p, contain NH2-terminal kinase domains that are 70% identical. Together with six other putative kinases from a number of organisms, these proteins define a new protein kinase family that we have named the Ark family. Lack of both Ark1p and Prk1p resulted in the formation of large cytoplasmic actin clumps and severe defects in cell growth. These defects were rescued by wild-type, but not by kinase-dead versions of the proteins. Elevated levels of either Ark1p or Prk1p caused a number of actin and cell morphological defects that were not observed when the kinase-dead versions were overexpressed instead. Ark1p and Prk1p were shown to localize to actin cortical patches, making these two kinases the first signaling proteins demonstrated to be patch components. These results suggest that Ark1p and Prk1p may be downstream effectors of signaling pathways that control actin patch organization and function. Furthermore, results of double-mutant analyses suggest that Ark1p and Prk1p function in overlapping but distinct pathways that regulate the cortical actin cytoskeleton."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Introduction: Animal studies suggest that up to 80% of intracellular T3 in the brain is derived from circulating T4 by local deiodination. We hypothesized that in patients on T4 common variants in the deiodinase genes might influence baseline psychological well-being and any improvement on combined T4/T3 without necessarily affecting serum thyroid hormone levels. Methods: We analyzed common variants in the three deiodinase genes vs. baseline psychological morbidity and response to T4/T3 in 552 subjects on T4 from the Weston Area T4 T3 Study (WATTS). Primary outcome was improvement in psychological well-being assessed by the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12). Results: The rarer CC genotype of the rs225014 polymorphism in the deiodinase 2 gene (DIO2) was present in 16% of the study population and was associated with worse baseline GHQ scores in patients on T4 (CC vs. TT genotype: 14.1 vs. 12.8, P = 0.03). In addition, this genotype showed greater improvement on T4/T3 therapy compared with T4 only by 2.3 GHQ points at 3 months and 1.4 at 12 months (P = 0.03 for repeated measures ANOVA). This polymorphism had no impact on circulating thyroid hormone levels. Conclusions: Our results require replication but suggest that commonly inherited variation in the DIO2 gene is associated both with impaired baseline psychological well-being on T4 and enhanced response to combination T4/T3 therapy, but did not affect serum thyroid hormone levels."</span>

We, therefore, examined chromosomal abnormalities by high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array in 88 MPN patients, as well as 71 cases with MPN-blast phase, and correlated these findings with their clinical parameters. Frequent genomic alterations were found in MPN after leukemic transformation with up to 3-fold more genomic changes per sample compared with samples in chronic phase (P &lt; .001). We identified commonly altered regions involved in disease progression including not only established targets (ETV6, TP53, and RUNX1) but also new candidate genes on 7q, 16q, 19p, and 21q. Moreover, trisomy 8 or amplification of 8q24 (MYC) was almost exclusively detected in JAK2V617F− cases with MPN-blast phase. Remarkably, copy number–neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNN-LOH) on either 7q or 9p including homozygous JAK2V617F was related to decreased survival after leukemic transformation (P = .01 and P = .016, respectively). Our high-density SNP-array analysis of MPN genomes in the chronic compared with leukemic stage identified novel target genes and provided prognostic insights associated with the evolution to leukemia."</span>

We investigated this hypothesis for a common ectoparasite of seabirds, the tick Ixodes uriae that is often found in mixed host sites. We examined patterns of neutral genetic variation between ticks collected from Black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) and Atlantic puffins (Fratercula arctica) in sympatry. To control for a potential distance effect, values were compared to differences among ticks from the same host in nearby monospecific sites. As predicted, there was higher genetic differentiation between ticks from different sympatric host species than between ticks from nearby allopatric populations of the same host species. Patterns suggesting isolation by distance were found among tick populations of each host group, but no such patterns existed between tick populations of different hosts. Overall, results suggest that host-related selection pressures have led to the specialization of I. uriae and that host race formation may be an important diversifying mechanism in parasites."</span>

High and low affinity binding sites for PGD 2 were identified in the CRTH2 receptor population by saturation analysis with respective equilibrium dissociation constants ( K D ) of 2.5 and 109 n M . This revealed that the affinity of PGD 2 for CRTH2 is eight times less than its affinity for the DP receptor. Equilibrium competition binding assays revealed that of the compounds tested, only PGD 2 and several related metabolites bound with high affinity to CRTH2 ( K i values ranging from 2.4 to 34.0 n M ) with the following rank order of potency: PGD 2 &gt;13,14‐dihydro‐15‐keto PGD 2 &gt;15‐deoxy‐Δ 12,14 ‐PGJ 2 &gt;PGJ 2 &gt;Δ 12 ‐PGJ 2 &gt;15(S)‐15 methyl‐PGD 2 .

Functional studies demonstrated that PGD 2 activation of recombinant CRTH2 results in decrease of intracellular cAMP in a pertussis toxin‐sensitive manner. Therefore, we showed that CRTH2 can functionally couple to the G‐protein G αi/o . PGD 2 and related metabolites were tested and their rank order of potency followed the results of the membrane binding assay. By Northern blot analysis, we showed that, besides haemopoietic cells, CRTH2 is expressed in many other tissues such as brain, heart, thymus, spleen and various tissues of the digestive system. In addition, in situ hybridization studies revealed that CRTH2 mRNA is expressed in human eosinophils.

HBV variants are currently classified into the human genotypes A to H and species-associated chimpanzee and gibbon/orangutan groups. To examine the role of recombination in the evolution of HBV, large-scale data retrieval and automated phylogenetic analysis (TreeOrder scanning) were carried out on all available published complete genome sequences of HBV. We detected a total of 24 phylogenetically independent potential recombinants (different genotype combinations or distinct breakpoints), eight of which were previously undescribed. Instances of intergenotype recombination were observed in all human and ape HBV variants, including evidence for a novel gibbon/genotype C recombinant among HBV variants from Vietnam. By recording sequence positions in trees generated from sequential fragments across the genome, violations of phylogeny between trees also provided evidence for frequent intragenotype recombination between members of genotypes A, D, F/H, and gibbon variants but not in B, C, or the Asian B/C recombinant group. In many cases, favored positions for both inter- and intragenotype recombination matched positions of phylogenetic reorganization between the human and ape genotypes, such as the end of the surface gene and the core gene, where sequence relationships between genotypes changed in the TreeOrder scan. These findings provide evidence for the occurrence of past, extensive recombination events in the evolutionary history of the currently classified genotypes of HBV and potentially in changes in its global epidemiology and associations with human disease."</span>

While cities struggle to provide water to these new residents, they will also face equally unprecedented hydrologic changes due to global climate change. Here we use a detailed hydrologic model, demographic projections, and climate change scenarios to estimate per-capita water availability for major cities in the developing world, where urban growth is the fastest. We estimate the amount of water physically available near cities and do not account for problems with adequate water delivery or quality. Modeled results show that currently 150 million people live in cities with perennial water shortage, defined as having less than 100 L per person per day of sustainable surface and groundwater flow within their urban extent. By 2050, demographic growth will increase this figure to almost 1 billion people. Climate change will cause water shortage for an additional 100 million urbanites. Freshwater ecosystems in river basins with large populations of urbanites with insufficient water will likely experience flows insufficient to maintain ecological process. Freshwater fish populations will likely be impacted, an issue of special importance in regions such as India's Western Ghats, where there is both rapid urbanization and high levels of fish endemism.

To date it has not been possible to observe the destruction of any pathogen by CD8 + T cells in vivo. Here we demonstrate a technique for imaging the killing of liver-stage malaria parasites by CD8 + T cells bearing a transgenic T cell receptor specific for a parasite epitope. We report several features that have not been described by in vitro analysis of the process, chiefly the formation of large clusters of effector CD8 + T cells around infected hepatocytes. The formation of clusters requires antigen-specific CD8 + T cells and signaling by G protein-coupled receptors, although CD8 + T cells of unrelated specificity are also recruited to clusters. By combining mathematical modeling and data analysis, we suggest that formation of clusters is mainly driven by enhanced recruitment of T cells into larger clusters. We further show various death phenotypes of the parasite, which typically follow prolonged interactions between infected hepatocytes and CD8 + T cells. These findings stress the need for intravital imaging for dissecting the fine mechanisms of pathogen recognition and killing by CD8 + T cells."</span>

In an effort to better understand the structural basis for the function of these channels, the structure of the MscL homolog from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was determined by x-ray crystallography to 3.5 angstroms resolution. This channel is organized as a homopentamer, with each subunit containing two transmembrane α helices and a third cytoplasmic α helix. From the extracellular side, a water-filled opening approximately 18 angstroms in diameter leads into a pore lined with hydrophilic residues which narrows at the cytoplasmic side to an occluded hydrophobic apex that may act as the channel gate.

Formation of magnetosome chains was found to be controlled by a set of specific proteins in Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense and other MTB. However, the contribution of abiotic factors on magnetosome chain assembly has not been fully explored. Here, we first analyzed the effect of growth conditions on magnetosome chain formation in M. gryphiswaldense by electron microscopy. Whereas higher temperatures (30 to 35°C) and high oxygen concentrations caused increasingly disordered chains and smaller magnetite crystals, growth at 20°C and anoxic conditions resulted in long chains with mature cuboctahedron-shaped crystals. In order to analyze the magnetosome chain in electron microscopy data sets in a more quantitative and unbiased manner, we developed a computerized image analysis algorithm. The collected data comprised the cell dimensions and particle size and number as well as the intracellular position and extension of the magnetosome chain. The chain analysis program (CHAP) was used to evaluate the effects of the genetic and growth conditions on magnetosome chain formation. This was compared and correlated to data obtained from bulk magnetic measurements of wild-type (WT) and mutant cells displaying different chain configurations.

These observations imply that, in each case, an intron presence–absence polymorphism must have existed in the past. Such a polymorphism, created by a recent intron-loss mutation, is reported here in a eukaryotic organism. This gene structure, detected in the jingwei ( jgw ) gene, segregates at high frequency (77%) in natural populations of Drosophila teissieri and is associated with a marked change in mRNA levels. Furthermore, the intron loss does not result from a mRNA-mediated mechanism as is usually proposed, but from a partial deletion at the DNA level that also results in the addition of four new amino acids to the JGW protein. Population genetic analyses of the pattern of nucleotide variation surrounding the intron polymorphism indicate the action of positive Darwinian selection on the intron-absent variant.

The aim of our study was to provide an unbiased catalog of gene-expression changes in human diabetic kidney biopsy samples. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Affymetrix expression arrays were used to identify differentially regulated transcripts in 44 microdissected human kidney samples. DKD samples were significant for their racial diversity and decreased glomerular filtration rate (~25–35 mL/min). Stringent statistical analysis, using the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected two-tailed t test, was used to identify differentially expressed transcripts in control and diseased glomeruli and tubuli. Two different web-based algorithms were used to define differentially regulated pathways. RESULTS We identified 1,700 differentially expressed probesets in DKD glomeruli and 1,831 in diabetic tubuli, and 330 probesets were commonly differentially expressed in both compartments. Pathway analysis highlighted the regulation of Ras homolog gene family member A, Cdc42, integrin, integrin-linked kinase, and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling in DKD glomeruli. The tubulointerstitial compartment showed strong enrichment for inflammation-related pathways. The canonical complement signaling pathway was determined to be statistically differentially regulated in both DKD glomeruli and tubuli and was associated with increased glomerulosclerosis even in a different set of DKD samples. CONCLUSIONS Our studies have cataloged gene-expression regulation and identified multiple novel genes and pathways that may play a role in the pathogenesis of DKD or could serve as biomarkers."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"ABSTRACT Bats harbor a large diversity of coronaviruses (CoVs), several of which are related to zoonotic pathogens that cause severe disease in humans. Our screening of bat samples collected in Kenya from 2007 to 2010 not only detected RNA from several novel CoVs but, more significantly, identified sequences that were closely related to human CoVs NL63 and 229E, suggesting that these two human viruses originate from bats. We also demonstrated that human CoV NL63 is a recombinant between NL63-like viruses circulating in Triaenops bats and 229E-like viruses circulating in Hipposideros bats, with the breakpoint located near 5′ and 3′ ends of the spike (S) protein gene. In addition, two further interspecies recombination events involving the S gene were identified, suggesting that this region may represent a recombination “hot spot” in CoV genomes. Finally, using a combination of phylogenetic and distance-based approaches, we showed that the genetic diversity of bat CoVs is primarily structured by host species and subsequently by geographic distances. IMPORTANCE Understanding the driving forces of cross-species virus transmission is central to understanding the nature of disease emergence. Previous studies have demonstrated that bats are the ultimate reservoir hosts for a number of coronaviruses (CoVs), including ancestors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E). However, the evolutionary pathways of bat CoVs remain elusive. We provide evidence for natural recombination between distantly related African bat coronaviruses associated with Triaenops afer and Hipposideros sp. bats that resulted in a NL63-like virus, an ancestor of the human pathogen HCoV-NL63. These results suggest that interspecies recombination may play an important role in CoV evolution and the emergence of novel CoVs with zoonotic potential."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Motivation: The result of a typical microarray experiment is a long list of genes with corresponding expression measurements. This list is only the starting point for a meaningful biological interpretation. Modern methods identify relevant biological processes or functions from gene expression data by scoring the statistical significance of predefined functional gene groups, e.g. based on Gene Ontology (GO). We develop methods that increase the explanatory power of this approach by integrating knowledge about relationships between the GO terms into the calculation of the statistical significance. Results: We present two novel algorithms that improve GO group scoring using the underlying GO graph topology. The algorithms are evaluated on real and simulated gene expression data. We show that both methods eliminate local dependencies between GO terms and point to relevant areas in the GO graph that remain undetected with state-of-the-art algorithms for scoring functional terms. A simulation study demonstrates that the new methods exhibit a higher level of detecting relevant biological terms than competing methods.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Variants in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) were recently found to increase the risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In the brain, TREM2 is predominately expressed on microglia, and its association with AD adds to increasing evidence implicating a role for the innate immune system in AD initiation and progression. Thus far, studies have found TREM2 is protective in the response to amyloid pathology while variants leading to a loss of TREM2 function impair microglial signaling and are deleterious. However, the potential role of TREM2 in the context of tau pathology has not yet been characterized. In this study, we crossed Trem2 +/+ (T2 +/+ ) and Trem2 −/− (T2 −/− ) mice to the PS19 human tau transgenic line (PS) to investigate whether loss of TREM2 function affected tau pathology, the microglial response to tau pathology, or neurodegeneration. Strikingly, by 9 mo of age, T2 −/− PS mice exhibited significantly less brain atrophy as quantified by ventricular enlargement and preserved cortical volume in the entorhinal and piriform regions compared with T2 +/+ PS mice. However, no TREM2-dependent differences were observed for phosphorylated tau staining or insoluble tau levels. Rather, T2 −/− PS mice exhibited significantly reduced microgliosis in the hippocampus and piriform cortex compared with T2 +/+ PS mice. Gene expression analyses and immunostaining revealed microglial activation was significantly attenuated in T2 −/− PS mice, and there were lower levels of inflammatory cytokines and astrogliosis. These unexpected findings suggest that impairing microglial TREM2 signaling reduces neuroinflammation and is protective against neurodegeneration in the setting of pure tauopathy."</span>

We show here that several simple criteria, based on cell and module performance data, serve to evaluate and compare all types of today's solar cells. Analyzing these data allows to gauge in how far significant progress can be expected for the various cell types and, most importantly from both the science and technology points of view, if basic bounds, beyond those known today, may exist, that can limit such progress. This is important, because half a century after Shockley and Queisser (SQ) presented limits, based on detailed balance calculations for single absorber solar cells, those are still held to be the only ones, we need to consider; most efforts to go beyond SQ are directed towards attempts to circumvent them, primarily via smart optics, or optoelectronics.

Liver-derived NKT cells were used in these studies because of their relative abundance in this organ, and it was assumed that they were representative of NKT cells from other sites. We compared NKT cells from liver, thymus, and spleen for their ability to mediate rejection of the sarcoma cell line (MCA-1) in vivo, and found that this was a specialized function of liver-derived NKT cells. Furthermore, when CD4+ and CD4− liver-derived NKT cells were administered separately, MCA-1 rejection was mediated primarily by the CD4− fraction. Very similar results were achieved using the B16F10 melanoma metastasis model, which requires NKT cell stimulation with α-galactosylceramide. The impaired ability of thymus-derived NKT cells was due, in part, to their production of IL-4, because tumor immunity was clearly enhanced after transfer of IL-4–deficient thymus-derived NKT cells. This is the first study to demonstrate the existence of functionally distinct NKT cell subsets in vivo and may shed light on the long-appreciated paradox that NKT cells function as immunosuppressive cells in some disease models, whereas they promote cell-mediated immunity in others."</span>

A deeper understanding of the NB tumor microenvironment (TME) remains an area of active research but there is a lack of reliable and biomimetic experimental models. This study utilizes a 3D bioprinting approach, in combination with NB spheroids, to create an in vitro vascular model of NB for exploring the tumor function within an endothelialized microenvironment. A gelatin methacryloyl (gelMA) bioink is used to create multi‐channel cubic tumor analogues with high printing fidelity and mechanical tunability. Human‐derived NB spheroids and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are incorporated into the biomanufactured gelMA and cocultured under static versus dynamic conditions, demonstrating high levels of survival and growth. Quantification of NB‐EC integration and tumor cell migration suggested an increased aggressive behavior of NB when cultured in bioprinted endothelialized models, when cocultured with HUVECs, and also as a result of dynamic culture. This model also allowed for the assessment of metabolic, cytokine, and gene expression profiles of NB spheroids under varying TME conditions. These results establish a high throughput research enabling platform to study the TME‐mediated cellular‐molecular mechanisms of tumor growth, aggression, and response to therapy."</span>

Given the multiple purposes of many protected areas, measuring effectiveness is difficult. Our review of 49 tropical protected areas shows that parks are generally effective at curtailing deforestation within their boundaries. But deforestation in surrounding areas is isolating protected areas. Many initiatives now aim to link protected areas to local socioeconomic development. Some of these initiatives have been successful, but in general expectations need to be tempered regarding the capacity of protected areas to alleviate poverty.

In yeast, Rad53 kinase protects stalled replication forks from pathological rearrangements. To characterize the mechanisms controlling fork integrity, we analyzed replication intermediates formed in response to replication blocks using electron microscopy. At the forks, wild-type cells accumulate short single-stranded regions, which likely causes checkpoint activation, whereas rad53 mutants exhibit extensive single-stranded gaps and hemi-replicated intermediates, consistent with a lagging-strand synthesis defect. Further, rad53 cells accumulate Holliday junctions through fork reversal. We speculate that, in checkpoint mutants, abnormal replication intermediates begin to form because of uncoordinated replication and are further processed by unscheduled recombination pathways, causing genome instability."</span>

Here, we demonstrate that nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in melanoma is linked to IL-1β production, inflammation, and immunosuppression. Analysis of cancer genome datasets (TCGA and GTEx) revealed greater NLRP3 and IL-1β expression in cutaneous melanoma samples ( n = 469) compared to normal skin ( n = 324), with a highly significant correlation between NLRP3 and IL-1β ( P &lt; 0.0001). We show the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in biopsies of metastatic melanoma using fluorescent resonance energy transfer analysis for NLRP3 and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD. In vivo, tumor-associated NLRP3/IL-1 signaling induced expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), leading to reduced natural killer and CD8 + T cell activity concomitant with an increased presence of regulatory T (Treg) cells in the primary tumors. Either genetic or pharmacological inhibition of tumor-derived NLRP3 by dapansutrile (OLT1177) was sufficient to reduce MDSCs expansion and to enhance antitumor immunity, resulting in reduced tumor growth. Additionally, we observed that the combination of NLRP3 inhibition and anti–PD-1 treatment significantly increased the antitumor efficacy of the monotherapy by limiting MDSC-mediated T cell suppression and tumor progression. These data show that NLRP3 activation in melanoma cells is a protumor mechanism, which induces MDSCs expansion and immune evasion. We conclude that inhibition of NLRP3 can augment the efficacy of anti–PD-1 therapy."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract Mounting evidence suggests that dynamic interactions between a tumor and its microenvironment play a critical role in tumor development, cell-cycle progression, and response to therapy. In this study, we used mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) as a model to characterize the mechanisms by which stroma regulate cell-cycle progression. We demonstrated that adhesion of MCL and other non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cells to bone marrow stromal cells resulted in a reversible G1 arrest associated with elevated p27Kip1 and p21 (WAF1) proteins. The adhesion-mediated p27Kip1 and p21 increases were posttranslationally regulated via the down-regulation of Skp2, a subunit of SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase. Overexpression of Skp2 in MCL decreased p27Kip1, whereas inhibition of Skp2 by siRNA increased p27Kip1 and p21 levels. Furthermore, we found cell adhesion up-regulated Cdh1 (an activating subunit of anaphase-promoting complex [APC] ubiquitin ligase), and reduction of Cdh1 by siRNA induced Skp2 accumulation and hence p27Kip1 degradation, thus implicating Cdh1 as an upstream effector of the Skp2/p27Kip1 signaling pathway. Overall, this report, for the first time, demonstrates that cell-cell contact controls the tumor cell cycle via ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathways in MCL and other NHLs. The understanding of this novel molecular pathway may prove valuable in designing new therapeutic approaches for modifying tumor cell growth and response to therapy."</span>

Targeting tumour-associated CXCR2 + neutrophils (TAN) or tumour-associated CCR2 + macrophages (TAM) alone improves antitumour immunity in preclinical models. However, a compensatory influx of an alternative myeloid subset may result in a persistent immunosuppressive TME and promote therapeutic resistance. Here, we show CCR2 and CXCR2 combined blockade reduces total tumour-infiltrating myeloids, promoting a more robust antitumour immune response in PDAC compared with either strategy alone. Methods Blood, bone marrow and tumours were analysed from PDAC patients and controls. Treatment response and correlative studies were performed in mice with established orthotopic PDAC tumours treated with a small molecule CCR2 inhibitor (CCR2i) and CXCR2 inhibitor (CXCR2i), alone and in combination with chemotherapy. Results A systemic increase in CXCR2 + TAN correlates with poor prognosis in PDAC, and patients receiving CCR2i showed increased tumour-infiltrating CXCR2 + TAN following treatment. In an orthotopic PDAC model, CXCR2 blockade prevented neutrophil mobilisation from the circulation and augmented chemotherapeutic efficacy. However, depletion of either CXCR2 + TAN or CCR2 + TAM resulted in a compensatory response of the alternative myeloid subset, recapitulating human disease. This was overcome by combined CCR2i and CXCR2i, which augmented antitumour immunity and improved response to FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"One of the impediments to the treatment of brain tumors (e.g., gliomas) has been the degree to which they expand, infiltrate surrounding tissue, and migrate widely into normal brain, usually rendering them “elusive” to effective resection, irradiation, chemotherapy, or gene therapy. We demonstrate that neural stem cells (NSCs), when implanted into experimental intracranial gliomas in vivo in adult rodents, distribute themselves quickly and extensively throughout the tumor bed and migrate uniquely in juxtaposition to widely expanding and aggressively advancing tumor cells, while continuing to stably express a foreign gene. The NSCs “surround” the invading tumor border while “chasing down” infiltrating tumor cells. When implanted intracranially at distant sites from the tumor (e.g., into normal tissue, into the contralateral hemisphere, or into the cerebral ventricles), the donor cells migrate through normal tissue targeting the tumor cells (including human glioblastomas). When implanted outside the CNS intravascularly, NSCs will target an intracranial tumor. NSCs can deliver a therapeutically relevant molecule—cytosine deaminase—such that quantifiable reduction in tumor burden results. These data suggest the adjunctive use of inherently migratory NSCs as a delivery vehicle for targeting therapeutic genes and vectors to refractory, migratory, invasive brain tumors. More broadly, they suggest that NSC migration can be extensive, even in the adult brain and along nonstereotypical routes, if pathology (as modeled here by tumor) is present."</span>

Virophages remained abundant in the lake 2 y later and were represented by populations with a high level of major capsid protein sequence variation (25–100% identity).

In axons early endosomes were confined to presynaptic terminals and to varicosities. The somatodendritic but not the presynaptic early endosomes were labeled by internalized transferrin. In contrast to early endosomes, late endosomes and lysosomes were shown to be predominantly located in the cell body. Video microscopy was used to follow the transport of internalized markers from the periphery of axons and dendrites back to the cell body. Labeled structures in both domains moved unidirectionally by retrograde fast transport. Axonally transported organelles were sectioned for EM after video microscopic observation and shown to be large multivesicular body-like structures. Similar structures accumulated at the distal side of an axonal lesion. Multivesicular bodies therefore appear to be the major structures mediating transport of endocytosed markers between the nerve terminals and the cell body.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Receptors that endocytose high-density lipoproteins (HDL) have been elusive. Here yolk-sac endoderm-like cells were used to identify an endocytic receptor for HDL. The receptor was isolated by HDL affinity chromatography and identified as cubilin, the recently described endocytic receptor for intrinsic factor-vitamin B 12 . Cubilin antibodies inhibit HDL endocytosis by the endoderm-like cells and in mouse embryo yolk-sac endoderm, a prominent site of cubilin expression. Cubilin-mediated HDL endocytosis is inhibitable by HDL 2 , HDL 3 , apolipoprotein (apo)A-I, apoA-II, apoE, and RAP, but not by low-density lipoprotein (LDL), oxidized LDL, VLDL, apoC-I, apoC-III, or heparin. These findings, coupled with the fact that cubilin is expressed in kidney proximal tubules, suggest a role for this receptor in embryonic acquisition of maternal HDL and renal catabolism of filterable forms of HDL."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract. When simulating the formation and life cycle of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) with chemical transport models, it is often assumed that organic molecules are well mixed within SOA particles on the timescale of 1 h. While this assumption has been debated vigorously in the literature, the issue remains unresolved in part due to a lack of information on the mixing times within SOA particles as a function of both temperature and relative humidity. Using laboratory data, meteorological fields, and a chemical transport model, we estimated how often mixing times are &lt; 1 h within SOA in the planetary boundary layer (PBL), the region of the atmosphere where SOA concentrations are on average the highest. First, a parameterization for viscosity as a function of temperature and RH was developed for α-pinene SOA using room-temperature and low-temperature viscosity data for α-pinene SOA generated in the laboratory using mass concentrations of ∼ 1000 µg m−3. Based on this parameterization, the mixing times within α-pinene SOA are &lt; 1 h for 98.5 % and 99.9 % of the occurrences in the PBL during January and July, respectively, when concentrations are significant (total organic aerosol concentrations are &gt; 0.5 µg m−3 at the surface). Next, as a starting point to quantify how often mixing times of organic molecules are &lt; 1 h within α-pinene SOA generated using low, atmospherically relevant mass concentrations, we developed a temperature-independent parameterization for viscosity using the room-temperature viscosity data for α-pinene SOA generated in the laboratory using a mass concentration of ∼ 70 µg m−3. Based on this temperature-independent parameterization, mixing times within α-pinene SOA are &lt; 1 h for 27 and 19.5 % of the occurrences in the PBL during January and July, respectively, when concentrations are significant. However, associated with these conclusions are several caveats, and due to these caveats we are unable to make strong conclusions about how often mixing times of organic molecules are &lt; 1 h within α-pinene SOA generated using low, atmospherically relevant mass concentrations. Finally, a parameterization for viscosity of anthropogenic SOA as a function of temperature and RH was developed using sucrose–water data. Based on this parameterization, and assuming sucrose is a good proxy for anthropogenic SOA, 70 and 83 % of the mixing times within anthropogenic SOA in the PBL are &lt; 1 h for January and July, respectively, when concentrations are significant. These percentages are likely lower limits due to the assumptions used to calculate mixing times."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The pan neurotrophin receptor p75 NTR signals programmed cell death both during nervous system development and after neural trauma and disease in the adult. However, the molecular pathways by which death is mediated remain poorly understood. Here, we show that this cell death is initiated by activation of G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK/Kir3) channels and a consequent potassium efflux. Death signals stimulated by neurotrophin-mediated cleavage of p75 NTR activate GIRK channels through the generation and binding of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P 2 /PIP2] to GIRK channels. Both GIRK channel activity and p75 NTR -mediated neuronal death are inhibited by sequestration of PtdIns(4,5)P 2 and application of GIRK channel inhibitors, whereas pertussis toxin treatment has no effect. Thus, p75 NTR activates GIRK channels without the need for G i/o -proteins. Our results demonstrate a novel mode of activation of GIRK channels, representing an early step in the p75 NTR -mediated cell death pathway and suggesting a function for these channels during nervous system development."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Ligand presentation is a major determinant of receptor activation. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a tyrosine kinase receptor, is activated by growth factors of the transforming growth factor α (TGFα) family. The tetraspanin CD9 interacts with transmembrane TGFα and decreases its ectodomain shedding to release soluble TGFα. Here we report that CD9 has a role in the maturation of transmembrane TGFα and its stabilization at the cell surface, and in the cell-surface distribution in polarized epithelial cells. Furthermore, coexpression of CD9 and TGFα confers changes in cytoskeletal organization with a decrease in actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, and changes in RhoA and Rac1 GTPase activity. These alterations are reversed by blocking EGFR signaling. Finally, we demonstrate changes in cell adhesion and migration resulting from coexpression of TGFα with CD9. These results provide insight into the role of CD9 in the presentation of TGFα in epithelial and carcinoma cells, whose physiology is driven by ligand-induced EGFR activation."</span>

In nontransformed cells, centrosome loss triggers a p53-dependent surveillance pathway that protects against genome instability by blocking cell growth. However, the mechanism by which p53 is activated in response to centrosome loss remains unknown. Here, we have used genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens to identify a USP28–53BP1–p53–p21 signaling axis at the core of the centrosome surveillance pathway. We show that USP28 and 53BP1 act to stabilize p53 after centrosome loss and demonstrate this function to be independent of their previously characterized role in the DNA damage response. Surprisingly, the USP28–53BP1–p53–p21 signaling pathway is also required to arrest cell growth after a prolonged prometaphase. We therefore propose that centrosome loss or a prolonged mitosis activate a common signaling pathway that acts to prevent the growth of cells that have an increased propensity for mitotic errors."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Expanding croplands to meet the needs of a growing population, changing diets, and biofuel production comes at the cost of reduced carbon stocks in natural vegetation and soils. Here, we present a spatially explicit global analysis of tradeoffs between carbon stocks and current crop yields. The difference among regions is striking. For example, for each unit of land cleared, the tropics lose nearly two times as much carbon (∼120 tons·ha −1 vs. ∼63 tons·ha −1 ) and produce less than one-half the annual crop yield compared with temperate regions (1.71 tons·ha −1 ·y −1 vs. 3.84 tons·ha −1 ·y −1 ). Therefore, newly cleared land in the tropics releases nearly 3 tons of carbon for every 1 ton of annual crop yield compared with a similar area cleared in the temperate zone. By factoring crop yield into the analysis, we specify the tradeoff between carbon stocks and crops for all areas where crops are currently grown and thereby, substantially enhance the spatial resolution relative to previous regional estimates. Particularly in the tropics, emphasis should be placed on increasing yields on existing croplands rather than clearing new lands. Our high-resolution approach can be used to determine the net effect of local land use decisions."</span>

Sponges, the most important marine source of biologically active natural products, have been frequently hypothesized to contain compounds of bacterial origin. This symbiont hypothesis, however, remained unproven because of a general inability to cultivate the suspected producers. However, we have recently identified an uncultured Pseudomonas sp. symbiont as the most likely producer of the defensive antitumor polyketide pederin in Paederus fuscipes beetles by cloning the putative biosynthesis genes. Here we report closely related genes isolated from the highly complex metagenome of the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei , which is the source of the onnamides and theopederins, a group of polyketides that structurally resemble pederin. Sequence features of the isolated genes clearly indicate that it belongs to a prokaryotic genome and should be responsible for the biosynthesis of almost the entire portion of the polyketide structure that is correlated with antitumor activity. Besides providing further proof for the role of the related beetle symbiont-derived genes, these findings raise intriguing ecological and evolutionary questions and have important general implications for the sustainable production of otherwise inaccessible marine drugs by using biotechnological strategies."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Summary Nitric oxide (NO) is an important defense molecule secreted by the squid Euprymna scolopes and sensed by the bacterial symbiont, Vibrio fischeri , via the NO sensor HnoX. HnoX inhibits colonization through an unknown mechanism. The genomic location of hnoX adjacent to hahK , a recently identified positive regulator of biofilm formation, suggested that HnoX may inhibit colonization by controlling biofilm formation, a key early step in colonization. Indeed, the deletion of hnoX resulted in early biofilm formation in vitro , an effect that was dependent on HahK and its putative phosphotransfer residues. An allele of hnoX that encodes a protein with increased activity severely delayed wrinkled colony formation. Control occurred at the level of transcription of the syp genes, which produce the polysaccharide matrix component. The addition of NO abrogated biofilm formation and diminished syp transcription, effects that required HnoX. Finally, an hnoX mutant formed larger symbiotic biofilms. This work has thus uncovered a host‐relevant signal controlling biofilm and a mechanism for the inhibition of biofilm formation by V. fischeri . The study of V. fischeri HnoX permits us to understand not only host‐associated biofilm mechanisms, but also the function of HnoX domain proteins as regulators of important bacterial processes."</span>

Using simultaneous intracortical and intrathalamic recordings, we demonstrate here that the thalamic deactivation occurring at sleep onset most often precedes that of the cortex by several minutes, whereas reactivation of both structures during awakening is synchronized. Delays between thalamus and cortex deactivations can vary from one subject to another when a similar cortical region is considered. In addition, heterogeneity in activity levels throughout the cortical mantle is larger than previously thought during the descent into sleep. Thus, asynchronous thalamo-cortical deactivation while falling asleep probably explains the production of hypnagogic hallucinations by a still-activated cortex and the common self-overestimation of the time needed to fall asleep."</span>

Smallpox and other orthopoxviruses express virulence factors that inhibit the host’s complement system. In this study, our goals were to characterize the ability of the smallpox inhibitor of complement enzymes, SPICE, to regulate human complement on the cell surface. We demonstrate that SPICE binds to a variety of cell types and that the heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans serve as attachment sites. A transmembrane-engineered version as well as soluble recombinant SPICE inhibited complement activation at the C3 convertase step with equal or greater efficiency than that of the related host regulators. Moreover, SPICE attached to glycosaminoglycans was more efficient than transmembrane SPICE. We also demonstrate that this virulence activity of SPICE on cells could be blocked by a mAb to SPICE.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"The regulation of cadherin-mediated adhesion at the cell surface underlies several morphogenetic processes. To investigate the role of cadherin regulation in morphogenesis and to begin to analyze the molecular mechanisms of cadherin regulation, we have screened for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that allow us to manipulate the adhesive state of the cadherin molecule. Xenopus C-cadherin is regulated during convergent extension movements of gastrulation. Treatment of animal pole tissue explants (animal caps) with the mesoderm-inducing factor activin induces tissue elongation and decreases the strength of C-cadherin–mediated adhesion between blastomeres (Brieher, W.M., and B.M. Gumbiner. 1994. J. Cell Biol. 126:519–527). We have generated a mAb to C-cadherin, AA5, that restores strong adhesion to activin-treated blastomeres. This C-cadherin activating antibody strongly inhibits the elongation of animal caps in response to activin without affecting mesodermal gene expression. Thus, the activin-induced decrease in C-cadherin adhesive activity appears to be required for animal cap elongation. Regulation of C-cadherin and its activation by mAb AA5 involve changes in the state of C-cadherin that encompass more than changes in its homophilic binding site. Although mAb AA5 elicited a small enhancement in the functional activity of the soluble C-cadherin ectodomain (CEC1-5), it was not able to restore cell adhesion activity to mutant C-cadherin lacking its cytoplasmic tail. Furthermore, activin treatment regulates the adhesion of Xenopus blastomeres to surfaces coated with two other anti–C-cadherin mAbs, even though these antibodies probably do not mediate adhesion through a normal homophilic binding mechanism. Moreover, mAb AA5 restores strong adhesion to these antibodies. mAb AA5 only activates adhesion of blastomeres to immobilized CEC1-5 when it binds to C-cadherin on the cell surface. It does not work when added to CEC1-5 on the substrate. Together these findings suggest that the regulation of C-cadherin by activin and its activation by mAb AA5 involve changes in its cellular organization or interactions with other cell components that are not intrinsic to the isolated protein."</span>

Presumably under conditions with restricted diffusion of the signal molecule, smaller population sizes could achieve such a state of QS induction. The plant-pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae , in which QS controls traits involved in epiphytic fitness and virulence, occurs on leaf surfaces in aggregates of various sizes. Because leaves often harbor limited surface water, we investigated the size of aggregates that would permit QS in a nonsaturated environment. QS induction was visualized via dual fluorescence of P. syringae cells harboring a transcriptional fusion of mRFP1 with ahlI , which exhibits N -acyl homoserine lactone-dependent transcriptional activity, and a constitutive GFP marker to account for all P. syringae cells on a leaf. Confocal microscopy revealed that, on wet leaves, no QS induction was evident within 2 days after inoculation, but it increased rapidly with increasing aggregate sizes &gt;40 and 22 cells per aggregate by 3 and 4 days, respectively. In contrast, QS induction was common in aggregates &gt;33 cells by 2 days after inoculation on dry leaves and increased rapidly with increasing aggregate sizes &gt;35 and 13 cells after 3 and 4 days, respectively.

Heretofore, information on host factor requirements for EV-D68 infection is scarce. Haploid genetic screening is a powerful tool to reveal factors involved in the entry of pathogens. We performed a genome-wide haploid screen with the EV-D68 prototype Fermon strain to obtain a comprehensive overview of cellular factors supporting EV-D68 infection. We identified and confirmed several genes involved in sialic acid (Sia) biosynthesis, transport, and conjugation to be essential for infection. Moreover, by using knockout cell lines and gene reconstitution, we showed that both α2,6- and α2,3-linked Sia can be used as functional cellular EV-D68 receptors. Importantly, the screen did not reveal a specific protein receptor, suggesting that EV-D68 can use multiple redundant sialylated receptors. Upon testing recent clinical strains, we identified strains that showed a similar Sia dependency, whereas others could infect cells lacking surface Sia, indicating they can use an alternative, nonsialylated receptor. Nevertheless, these Sia-independent strains were still able to bind Sia on human erythrocytes, raising the possibility that these viruses can use multiple receptors. Sequence comparison of Sia-dependent and Sia-independent EV-D68 strains showed that many changes occurred near the canyon that might allow alternative receptor binding.

IFT proteins are required for the formation and maintenance of flagella and cilia. We have previously shown that mouse mutants for two IFT proteins, IFT88 and IFT172, as well as Kif3a, a subunit of mouse kinesin 2, exhibit ventral spinal cord patterning defects that appear to result from reduced hedgehog(Hh) signaling. Although genetic epistasis experiments place IFT proteins downstream of the Hh receptor and upstream of the Gli transcription factors,the mechanism by which IFT regulates Gli function is unknown. The developing limb provides an excellent system to study Hh signaling, in particular as it allows a biological and molecular readout of both Gli activator and repressor function. Here we report that homozygous mutants for flexo (Fxo), a hypomorphic allele of mouse IFT88 generated in our ENU mutagenesis screen, exhibit polydactyly in all four limbs. Molecular analysis indicates that expression domains of multiple posteriorly restricted genes are expanded anteriorly in the mutant limbs, similar to loss of Gli3 transcriptional repressor function. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression is normal, yet Ptch1 and Gli1, two known targets of Hh signaling, are greatly reduced, consistent with loss of Shh signaling. Expression of Gli3 and Hand2 in the mutant limb indicates that the limb prepattern is abnormal. In addition, we show that partial loss-of-function mutations in another mouse IFT gene, Ift52(Ngd5), result in similar phenotypes and abnormal Hh signaling as Fxo, indicating a general requirement for IFT proteins in Hh signaling and patterning of multiple organs. Analysis of Ift88 and Shh double mutants indicates that, in mouse, IFT proteins are required for both Gli activator and repressor functions, and Gli proteins are insensitive to Hh ligand in the absence of IFT proteins. Finally, our biochemical studies demonstrate that IFT proteins are required for proteolytic processing of Gli3 in mouse embryos. In summary, our results indicate that IFT function is crucial in the control of both the positive and negative transcriptional activities of Gli proteins, and essential for Hh ligand-induced signaling cascade."</span>

Uptake at 37 degrees C exceeded binding at 4 degrees C by 2.5-fold and saturated after 20-30 min. During uptake at 37 degrees C, bound transferrin was internalized into a trypsin-resistant space. Trypsinization at 4 degrees C destroyed surface receptors, but with subsequent incubation at 37 degrees C, surface receptors rapidly appeared (albeit in reduced numbers), and uptake occurred at a decreased level. After endocytosis, transferrin was released, apparently intact, into the extracellular space. At 37 degrees C colloidal gold-transferrin (AuTf) clustered in coated pits and then appeared inside various intracellular membrane-bounded compartments. Small vesicles and tubules were labeled after short (5-10 min) incubations at 37 degrees C. Larger multivesicular endosomes became heavily labeled after longer (20-35 min) incubations. Multivesicular endosomes apparently fused with the plasma membrane and released their contents by exocytosis. None of these organelles appeared to be lysosomal in nature, and 98% of intracellular AuTf was localized in acid phosphatase-negative compartments. AuTf, like transferrin, was released with subsequent incubation at 37 degrees C. Freeze-dried and freeze-fractured reticulocytes confirmed the distribution of AuTf in reticulocytes and revealed the presence of clathrin-coated patches amidst the spectrin coating the inner surface of the plasma membrane. These data suggest that transferrin is internalized via coated pits and vesicles and demonstrate that transferrin and its receptor are recycled back to the plasma membrane after endocytosis."</span>

References 2 and 3 describe very detailed and careful electron-microscopy analyses of the fate of an endocytosed protein in reticulocytes, and point out, for the first time, the possible secretion of the content of multivesicular late endosomes into the extracellular space.
This study demonstrates that reticulocytes internalize transferrin via clathrin-coated pits and vesicles, and subsequently recycle both transferrin and its receptor back to the plasma membrane.

<span style="color:#0070c0">"TSH is the major stimulator of thyrocyte proliferation, but its role in thyroid carcinogenesis remains unclear. To address this question, we used a mouse model of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) (TRβPV/PV mice). These mice, harboring a dominantly negative mutation (PV) of the thyroid hormone-β receptor (TRβ), exhibit increased serum thyroid hormone and elevated TSH. To eliminate TSH growth-stimulating effect, TRβPV/PV mice were crossed with TSH receptor gene knockout (TSHR−/−) mice. Wild-type siblings of TRβPV/PV mice were treated with an antithyroid agent, propylthiouracil, to elevate serum TSH for evaluating long-term TSH effect (WT-PTU mice). Thyroids from TRβPV/PVTSHR−/− showed impaired growth with no occurrence of FTC. Both WT-PTU and TRβPV/PV mice displayed enlarged thyroids, but only TRβPV/PV mice developed metastatic FTC. Molecular analyses indicate that PV acted, via multiple mechanisms, to activate the integrins-Src-focal adhesion kinase-p38 MAPK pathway and affect cytoskeletal restructuring to increase tumor cell migration and invasion. Thus, growth stimulated by TSH is a prerequisite but not sufficient for metastatic cancer to occur. Additional genetic alterations (such as PV), destined to alter focal adhesion and migration capacities, are required to empower hyperplastic follicular cells to invade and metastasize. These in vivo findings provide new insights in understanding carcinogenesis of the human thyroid."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Abstract All-trans retinoic acid (tRA)–induced differentiation in NB4 cells, a cell line derived from an acute promyelocytic leukemia patient with t(15;17) translocation, is markedly facilitated by sodium butyrate (NaB), a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI), or by hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), a non–HDACI tRA-differentiation inducer, as determined by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction. The tRA-induced expression of RIG-G, Bfl-1/A1, and p21waf1 and, to a lesser extent, of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein–ε (C/EBPε) are also enhanced by such combined treatments. Both responses are associated with a facilitated diminution of the leukemogenic PML-RARα protein and retained ΔPML-RARα, a cleavage product. Treatment with tRA in tRA differentiation–resistant NB4 subclones R4 and MR-2 does not result in PML-RARα diminution and the tested gene expressions. Moreover, the addition of HMBA or NaB with tRA results in only minimal increase of differentiation in the tRA differentiation–resistant subclones. The increases in acetylated histone H3 (AcH3) and AcH4 in NaB-treated NB4, R4, and MR-2 cells are similar and do not correlate with the extent of differentiation induction when NaB and HMBA are given in combination with tRA. Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) treatment results in the total degradation of PML-RARα without increasing AcH3 or AcH4 or inducing differentiation in R4 cells. As2O3 in combination with tRA induces gene (Bfl-1/A1 and C/EBPε) expression and partial differentiation. Both NaB and HMBA addition to As2O3-plus-tRA–treated R4 cells further enhances differentiation. These results suggest that elimination of the dominant negative PML-RARα protein is required prior to inhibition of histone deacetylase to fully overcome tRA-differentiation resistance in APL cells."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Although human existence is enveloped by ideologies, remarkably little is understood about the relationships between ideological attitudes and psychological traits. Even less is known about how cognitive dispositions—individual differences in how information is perceived and processed— sculpt individuals' ideological worldviews, proclivities for extremist beliefs and resistance (or receptivity) to evidence. Using an unprecedented number of cognitive tasks ( n = 37) and personality surveys ( n = 22), along with data-driven analyses including drift-diffusion and Bayesian modelling, we uncovered the specific psychological signatures of political, nationalistic, religious and dogmatic beliefs. Cognitive and personality assessments consistently outperformed demographic predictors in accounting for individual differences in ideological preferences by 4 to 15-fold. Furthermore, data-driven analyses revealed that individuals’ ideological attitudes mirrored their cognitive decision-making strategies. Conservatism and nationalism were related to greater caution in perceptual decision-making tasks and to reduced strategic information processing, while dogmatism was associated with slower evidence accumulation and impulsive tendencies. Religiosity was implicated in heightened agreeableness and risk perception. Extreme pro-group attitudes, including violence endorsement against outgroups, were linked to poorer working memory, slower perceptual strategies, and tendencies towards impulsivity and sensation-seeking—reflecting overlaps with the psychological profiles of conservatism and dogmatism. Cognitive and personality signatures were also generated for ideologies such as authoritarianism, system justification, social dominance orientation, patriotism and receptivity to evidence or alternative viewpoints; elucidating their underpinnings and highlighting avenues for future research. Together these findings suggest that ideological worldviews may be reflective of low-level perceptual and cognitive functions.

At 0–30 s after contact, TCR microclusters are colocalized with activated forms of Lck, ZAP-70, and the linker for activation of T cells. By 2 min, activated kinases are reduced in the older central microclusters, but are abundant in younger peripheral microclusters. By 5 min, TCR in the central supramolecular activation cluster have reduced activated kinases, whereas faint peripheral TCR microclusters efficiently generated activated Lck and ZAP-70. TCR microcluster formation is resistant to inhibition by Src family kinase inhibitor PP2, but is abrogated by actin polymerization inhibitor latrunculin A. We propose that Src kinase–independent formation of TCR microclusters in response to agonist MHC–peptide provides an actin-dependent scaffold for signal amplification."</span>

This paper, along with references 22 and 80, describes the formation of dynamic and highly motile TCR microclusters at the periphery of the cSMAC, and indicate that they serve as platforms for active signalling during TCR–peptide–MHC interaction. Surprisingly, TCR microclusters move towards the cSMAC from the periphery, and TCR microclusters within the cSMAC were shown not to be associated with signalling molecules, which supports the possibility that the cSMAC is involved in receptor internalization and signal attenuation.
This work shows that early TCR microcluster formation is independent of Src-family kinases but dependent on actin polymerization, providing a scaffold for sustained signaling

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Amutation in the small GTPase Rab38 gives rise to the mouse coat color phenotype “chocolate” (cht), implicating Rab38 in the regulation of melanogenesis. However, its role remains poorly characterized. We report that cht Rab38G19V is inactive and that the nearly normal pigmentation in cht melanocytes results from functional compensation by the closely related Rab32. In cht cells treated with Rab32-specific small interfering RNA, a dramatic loss of pigmentation is observed. In addition to mature melanosomes, Rab38 and Rab32 localize to perinuclear vesicles carrying tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein 1, consistent with a role in the intracellular sorting of these proteins. In Rab38/Rab32-deficient cells, tyrosinase appears to be mistargeted and degraded after exit from the trans-Golgi network (TGN). This suggests that Rab38 and Rab32 regulate a critical step in the trafficking of melanogenic enzymes, in particular, tyrosinase, from the TGN to melanosomes. This work identifies a key role for the Rab38/Rab32 subfamily of Rab proteins in the biogenesis of melanosomes and potentially other lysosome-related organelles."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"In multicellular organisms, circadian oscillators are organized into multitissue systems which function as biological clocks that regulate the activities of the organism in relation to environmental cycles and provide an internal temporal framework. To investigate the organization of a mammalian circadian system, we constructed a transgenic rat line in which luciferase is rhythmically expressed under the control of the mouse Per1 promoter. Light emission from cultured suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of these rats was invariably and robustly rhythmic and persisted for up to 32 days in vitro. Liver, lung, and skeletal muscle also expressed circadian rhythms, which damped after two to seven cycles in vitro. In response to advances and delays of the environmental light cycle, the circadian rhythm of light emission from the SCN shifted more rapidly than did the rhythm of locomotor behavior or the rhythms in peripheral tissues. We hypothesize that a self-sustained circadian pacemaker in the SCN entrains circadian oscillators in the periphery to maintain adaptive phase control, which is temporarily lost following large, abrupt shifts in the environmental light cycle."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Natural killer (NK) cells hold promise for improving the therapeutic potential of allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation, but their effectiveness is limited by inhibitory HLA types. We sought to overcome this intrinsic resistance by transducing CD56+CD3- NK cells with chimeric receptors directed against CD19, a molecule widely expressed by malignant B cells. An abundance of NK cells for transduction was secured by culturing peripheral blood mononuclear cells with K562 cells expressing the NK-stimulatory molecules 4-1BB ligand and interleukin 15, which yielded a median greater than 1000-fold expansion of CD56+CD3- cells at 3 weeks of culture, without T-lymphocyte expansion. Expression of anti-CD19 receptors linked to CD3ζ overcame NK resistance and markedly enhanced NK-cell-mediated killing of leukemic cells. This result was significantly improved by adding the 4-1BB costimulatory molecule to the chimeric anti-CD19-CD3ζ receptor; the cytotoxicity produced by NK cells expressing this construct uniformly exceeded that of NK cells whose signaling receptors lacked 4-1BB, even when natural cytotoxicity was apparent. Addition of 4-1BB was also associated with increased cell activation and production of interferon γ and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Our findings indicate that enforced expression of signaling receptors by NK cells might circumvent inhibitory signals, providing a novel means to enhance the effectiveness of allogeneic stem cell transplantation."</span>

We present the characterisation of an N-cyano pyrrolidine compound, FT3967385, with high selectivity for USP30. We demonstrate that ubiquitylation of TOM20, a component of the outer mitochondrial membrane import machinery, represents a robust biomarker for both USP30 loss and inhibition. A proteomics analysis, on a SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cell line model, directly compares the effects of genetic loss of USP30 with chemical inhibition. We have thereby identified a subset of ubiquitylation events consequent to mitochondrial depolarisation that are USP30 sensitive. Within responsive elements of the ubiquitylome, several components of the outer mitochondrial membrane transport (TOM) complex are prominent. Thus, our data support a model whereby USP30 can regulate the availability of ubiquitin at the specific site of mitochondrial PINK1 accumulation following membrane depolarisation. USP30 deubiquitylation of TOM complex components dampens the trigger for the Parkin-dependent amplification of mitochondrial ubiquitylation leading to mitophagy. Accordingly, PINK1 generation of phospho-Ser65 ubiquitin proceeds more rapidly in cells either lacking USP30 or subject to USP30 inhibition."</span>

To determine the T cell repertoire involved in the response to Hsp60, T cell clones from C57BL/6 mice immunized with rHsp60 were generated and examined for Vβ usage by flow cytometry and RT-PCR. Vβ8.1/8.2+ T cells were preferentially expanded; other clones bore Vβ4, -6, or -11. When Vβ8.1/8.2+ cells were depleted in mice, Vβ4+ T cell clones were almost exclusively isolated. Measurement of cytokine production demonstrated that nine of 16 Vβ8.1/8.2+ clones were Th1, while only three of 13 non-Vβ8.1/8.2+ clones were Th1. In mice immunized with rHsp60, depletion of Vβ8.1/8.2+, but not Vβ6+ plus Vβ7+, T cells completely abolished the protective efficacy of Hsp60 to lethal and sublethal challenges. Examination of the TCR revealed that a subset of Vβ8.1/2+ clones that produced IFN-γ and were reactive to F3 shared a common CDR3 sequence, DGGQG. Transfer of these T cell clones into TCR α/β−/− or IFN-γ−/− mice significantly improved survival, while transfer of other Vβ8.1/8.2+ clones that were F3 reactive but were Th2 or clones that were not reactive to F3 but were Th1 did not confer protection. These data indicate that a distinct subset of Vβ8.1/8.2+ T cells is crucial for the generation of a protective response to rHsp60."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"At least one polar body, almost invariably the second, persists intact to the early blastocyst stage in nearly two-thirds of mouse conceptuses of the PO strain. The distribution in early blastocysts of these surviving polar bodies was highly non-random. Most not only lay in the mid-region of the embryonic-abembryonic axis but, on discovering that early blastocysts are bilaterally rather than radially symmetrical about this axis, were found to align with the bilateral axis. Cell marking experiments failed to detect movement of polar bodies relative to the surface of the conceptus during either cleavage or blastulation. That the distribution of degenerating polar bodies and their presumed debris was similar to intact ones also argued against their motility, as did the finding that at all stages second polar bodies were attached to conceptuses by a thin, extensible, weakly elastic ‘tether’. Although the transfer of small fluorochromes between them was rarely observed beyond second cleavage, the second polar body and conceptus could remain coupled ionically up to the blastocyst stage. It is concluded that the second polar body normally remains attached to the conceptus through persistence of the intercellular bridge formed during its abstriction, and therefore provides an enduring marker of the animal pole of the zygote. Hence, according to the distribution of polar bodies, the axis of bilateral symmetry of the early blastocysts is normally aligned with the animal-vegetal axis of the zygote and its embryonic-abembryonic axis is orthogonal to it. Such relationships suggest that, at least in undisturbed development, specification of the axes of the blastocyst depends on spatial patterning of the zygote."</span>

<span style="color:#0070c0">"Medical implants, like cardiovascular devices, improve the quality of life for countless individuals but may become infected with bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus . Such infections take the form of a biofilm, a structured community of bacterial cells adherent to the surface of a solid substrate. Every biofilm begins with an attractive force or bond between bacterium and substratum. We used atomic force microscopy to probe experimentally forces between a fibronectin-coated surface (i.e., proxy for an implanted cardiac device) and fibronectin-binding receptors on the surface of individual living bacteria from each of 80 clinical isolates of S. aureus . These isolates originated from humans with infected cardiac devices (CDI; n = 26), uninfected cardiac devices ( n = 20), and the anterior nares of asymptomatic subjects ( n = 34). CDI isolates exhibited a distinct binding-force signature and had specific single amino acid polymorphisms in fibronectin-binding protein A corresponding to E652D, H782Q, and K786N. In silico molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that residues D652, Q782, and N786 in fibronectin-binding protein A form extra hydrogen bonds with fibronectin, complementing the higher binding force and energy measured by atomic force microscopy for the CDI isolates.

We employed a range of robust phylodynamic methods and genome subsampling strategies to infer the epidemiological history of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in these four countries. We compared these results to transmission clusters identified by the New Zealand Ministry of Health by contact tracing strategies. We estimated the effective reproduction number of COVID-19 as 1–1.4 during early stages of the pandemic and show that it declined below 1 as human movement was restricted. We also showed that this disease was introduced many times into each country and that introductions slowed down markedly following the reduction of international travel in mid-March 2020. Finally, we confirmed that New Zealand transmission clusters identified via standard health surveillance strategies largely agree with those defined by genomic data.

Myelin can be restored by regenerating oligodendrocytes from resident progenitors; however, it is not known whether regeneration restores the complex myelination patterns in cortical circuits. Here, we performed time lapse in vivo two photon imaging in somatosensory cortex of adult mice to define the kinetics and specificity of myelin regeneration after acute oligodendrocyte ablation. These longitudinal studies revealed that the pattern of myelination in cortex changed dramatically after regeneration, as new oligodendrocytes were formed in different locations and new sheaths were often established along axon segments previously lacking myelin. Despite the dramatic increase in axonal territory available, oligodendrogenesis was persistently impaired in deeper cortical layers that experienced higher gliosis. Repeated reorganization of myelin patterns in MS may alter circuit function and contribute to cognitive decline."</span>
