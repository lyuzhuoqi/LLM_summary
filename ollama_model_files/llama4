SYSTEM You are an expert scientific assistant specialized in generating concise, accurate, and insightful bibliography annotations. Your task is to analyze and summarize complex scientific abstracts, distilling key findings, methodologies, and contributions into clear, high-quality annotations. You possess deep knowledge of scientific terminology, research methodologies, and academic literature across disciplines. Focus on highlighting novel approaches, significant results, and broader implications while maintaining precision and brevity. Output only the final annotation without additional commentary or formatting, and please make your annotation around the provided length.

MESSAGE user [Abstract] CD30 is up-regulated in several human diseases and viral infections but its role in immune regulation is poorly understood. Here, we report the expression of a functional soluble CD30 homologue, viral CD30 (vCD30), encoded by ectromelia (mousepox) virus, a poxvirus that causes a severe disease related to human smallpox. We show that vCD30 is a 12-kD secreted protein that not only binds CD30L with high affinity and prevents its interaction with CD30, but it also induces reverse signaling in cells expressing CD30L. vCD30 blocked the generation of interferon γ–producing cells in vitro and was a potent inhibitor of T helper cell (Th)1- but not Th2-mediated inflammation in vivo. The finding of a CD30 homologue encoded by ectromelia virus suggests a role for CD30 in antiviral defense. Characterization of the immunological properties of vCD30 has uncovered a role of CD30–CD30L interactions in the generation of inflammatory responses. [Word count: 56]	

MESSAGE assistant References 38 and 39 report the identification of a CD30 homologue encoded by poxviruses. Reference 39 also shows that viral CD30 is the first example of a viral cytokine receptor that induces reverse signalling when binding its ligand, and provides evidence of a role for host CD30 in T H 1 inflammatory responses.

MESSAGE user [Abstract] Carbon monoxide occurs at relatively high concentrations (≥800 parts per million) in Mars’ atmosphere, where it represents a potentially significant energy source that could fuel metabolism by a localized putative surface or near-surface microbiota. However, the plausibility of CO oxidation under conditions relevant for Mars in its past or at present has not been evaluated. Results from diverse terrestrial brines and saline soils provide the first documentation, to our knowledge, of active CO uptake at water potentials (−41 MPa to −117 MPa) that might occur in putative brines at recurrent slope lineae (RSL) on Mars. Results from two extremely halophilic isolates complement the field observations. Halorubrum str. BV1, isolated from the Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah (to our knowledge, the first documented extremely halophilic CO-oxidizing member of the Euryarchaeota), consumed CO in a salt-saturated medium with a water potential of −39.6 MPa; activity was reduced by only 28% relative to activity at its optimum water potential of −11 MPa. A proteobacterial isolate from hypersaline Mono Lake, California, Alkalilimnicola ehrlichii MLHE-1, also oxidized CO at low water potentials (−19 MPa), at temperatures within ranges reported for RSL, and under oxic, suboxic (0.2% oxygen), and anoxic conditions (oxygen-free with nitrate). MLHE-1 was unaffected by magnesium perchlorate or low atmospheric pressure (10 mbar). These results collectively establish the potential for microbial CO oxidation under conditions that might obtain at local scales (e.g., RSL) on contemporary Mars and at larger spatial scales earlier in Mars’ history.

MESSAGE user [Abstract] Abstract Inhibition of class II trans-activator (CIITA) expression prevents embryonic trophoblast cells from up-regulating MHC class II genes in response to IFN-γ. This is thought to be one mechanism of maternal tolerance to the fetal allograft. The CIITA gene is regulated by four distinct promoters; promoter III directs constitutive (B cell) expression, and promoter IV regulates IFN-γ-inducible expression. Using in vivo genomic footprinting, promoter-reporter analysis, Southern blot analysis, and RT-PCR, we have examined the cause of CIITA silencing in a trophoblast-derived cell line. We report here that methylation of promoter IV DNA at CpG sites in Jar cells prevents promoter occupancy and IFN-γ-inducible transcription. The inhibition of CpG methylation in Jar cells by treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine restores IFN-γ inducibility to CIITA. This is the first description of an epigenetic mechanism involved in regulation of CIITA and MHC class II gene expression. [Word count: 21]

MESSAGE assistant References 43 and 44 report that the gene encoding CIITA is irreversibly silenced in trophoblasts by DNA methylation of pIV.

MESSAGE user [Abstract] High-throughput direct sequencing techniques have recently opened the possibility to sequence genomes from Pleistocene organisms. Here we analyze DNA sequences determined from a Neandertal, a mammoth, and a cave bear. We show that purines are overrepresented at positions adjacent to the breaks in the ancient DNA, suggesting that depurination has contributed to its degradation. We furthermore show that substitutions resulting from miscoding cytosine residues are vastly overrepresented in the DNA sequences and drastically clustered in the ends of the molecules, whereas other substitutions are rare. We present a model where the observed substitution patterns are used to estimate the rate of deamination of cytosine residues in single- and double-stranded portions of the DNA, the length of single-stranded ends, and the frequency of nicks. The results suggest that reliable genome sequences can be obtained from Pleistocene organisms.	[Word count: 26]

MESSAGE user [Abstract] Summary: Annotating genetic variants, especially non-coding variants, for the purpose of identifying pathogenic variants remains a challenge. Combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) is an algorithm designed to annotate both coding and non-coding variants, and has been shown to outperform other annotation algorithms. CADD trains a linear kernel support vector machine (SVM) to differentiate evolutionarily derived, likely benign, alleles from simulated, likely deleterious, variants. However, SVMs cannot capture non-linear relationships among the features, which can limit performance. To address this issue, we have developed DANN. DANN uses the same feature set and training data as CADD to train a deep neural network (DNN). DNNs can capture non-linear relationships among features and are better suited than SVMs for problems with a large number of samples and features. We exploit Compute Unified Device Architecture-compatible graphics processing units and deep learning techniques such as dropout and momentum training to accelerate the DNN training. DANN achieves about a 19% relative reduction in the error rate and about a 14% relative increase in the area under the curve (AUC) metric over CADD’s SVM methodology.
